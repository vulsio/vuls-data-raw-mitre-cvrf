		{
			"type": "Description",
			"text": "RunAs (runas.exe) in Windows 2000 only creates one session instance at a time, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (RunAs hang) by creating a named pipe session with the authentication server without any request for service.  NOTE: the vendor disputes this vulnerability, however the vendor also presents a scenario in which other users could be affected if running on a Terminal Server. Therefore this is a vulnerability."
