  "notes": {
    "description": "Buffer overflow in htdigest in Apache 1.3.26 and 1.3.27 may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long user argument.  NOTE: since htdigest is normally only locally accessible and not setuid or setgid, there are few attack vectors which would lead to an escalation of privileges, unless htdigest is executed from a CGI program. Therefore this may not be a vulnerability.",
