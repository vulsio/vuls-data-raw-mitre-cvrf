			"text": "Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.0 through 6.0 allows remote attackers to bypass cross-frame scripting restrictions and capture keyboard events from other domains via an HTML document with Javascript that is outside a frameset that includes the target domain, then forcing the frameset to maintain focus.  NOTE: the discloser claimed that the vendor does not categorize this as a vulnerability, but it can be used in a spoofing scenario; the discloser provides alternate scenarios. Spoofing scenarios are currently included in CVE."
