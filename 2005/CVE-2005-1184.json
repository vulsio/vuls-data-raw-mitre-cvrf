    "description": "The TCP/IP stack in multiple operating systems allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a TCP packet with the correct sequence number but the wrong Acknowledgement number, which generates a large number of \"keep alive\" packets.  NOTE: some followups indicate that this issue could not be replicated.",
