    "description": "Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in PhpAuction 2.5 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the lan parameter to (1) index.php or (2) admin/index.php, or (3) the auction_id parameter to profile.php.  NOTE: there is evidence that viewnews.php and login.php may not be part of the PhpAuction product, so they are not included in this description.",
