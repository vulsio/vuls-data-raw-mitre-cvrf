    "description": "Multiple interpretation error in the image upload handling code in Invision Gallery 2.0.3 allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via HTML or script in an image whose type does not match its extension, which is rendered by Internet Explorer due to CVE-2005-3312.  NOTE: it could be argued that this vulnerability is due to a design flaw in Internet Explorer and the proper fix should be in that browser; if so, then this should not be treated as a vulnerability in Invision Gallery.",
