    "description": "** DISPUTED ** dotProject 2.0.1 and earlier leaves (1) phpinfo.php and (2) check.php accessible under the /docs/ directory after installation, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive configuration information.  NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue, saying that it could only occur if the administrator ignores the installation instructions as well as warnings generated by check.php.",
