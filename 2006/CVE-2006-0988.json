    "description": "The default configuration of the DNS Server service on Windows Server 2003 and Windows 2000, and the Microsoft DNS Server service on Windows NT 4.0, allows recursive queries and provides additional delegation information to arbitrary IP addresses, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (traffic amplification) via DNS queries with spoofed source IP addresses.",
