		"description": "Argument injection vulnerability in certain PHP 3.x, 4.x, and 5.x applications, when used with sendmail and when accepting remote input for the additional_parameters argument to the mail function, allows remote attackers to read and create arbitrary files via the sendmail -C and -X arguments.  NOTE: it could be argued that this is a class of technology-specific vulnerability, instead of a particular instance; if so, then this should not be included in CVE.",
