			"type": "Description",
			"text": "Untrusted search path vulnerability in the TrueVector service (VSMON.exe) in Zone Labs ZoneAlarm 6.x and Integrity does not search ZoneAlarm's own folders before other folders that are specified in a user's PATH, which might allow local users to execute code as SYSTEM by placing malicious DLLs into a folder that has insecure permissions, but is searched before ZoneAlarm's folder.  NOTE: since this issue is dependent on the existence of a vulnerability in a separate product (weak permissions of executables or libraries, or the execution of malicious code), perhaps it should not be included in CVE."
