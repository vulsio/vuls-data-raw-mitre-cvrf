		"description": "Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in Oracle Database Server 8.1.7.4, 9.0.1.5, 9.2.0.7, 10.1.0.5, and other versions have unknown impact and attack vectors in the (1) Advanced Replication component, as identified by Vuln# DB01, and (2) Oracle Spatial component, as identified by Vuln# DB10.
