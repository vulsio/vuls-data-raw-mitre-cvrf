		"description": "** DISPUTED **\n\nSQL injection vulnerability in search.php in Phorum 5.1.14 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the page parameter.  NOTE: the vendor has disputed this report, stating \"If a non positive integer or non-integer is used for the page parameter for a search URL, the search query will use a negative number for the LIMIT clause. This causes the query to break, showing no results.  It IS NOT however a sql injection error.\"  While the original report is from a researcher with mixed accuracy, as of 20060703, CVE does not have any additional information regarding this issue.",
