    "description": "The Symantec NAVOPTS.DLL ActiveX control (aka Symantec.Norton.AntiVirus.NAVOptions) 12.2.0.13, as used in Norton AntiVirus, Internet Security, and System Works 2005 and 2006, is designed for use only in application-embedded web browsers, which allows remote attackers to \"crash the control\" via unspecified vectors related to content on a web site, and place Internet Explorer into a \"defunct state\" in which remote attackers can execute arbitrary code in addition to other Symantec ActiveX controls, regardless of whether they are marked safe for scripting.  NOTE: this CVE was inadvertently used for an E-mail Auto-Protect issue, but that issue has been assigned CVE-2007-3771.",
