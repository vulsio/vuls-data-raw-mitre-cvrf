		"description": "Apple Remote Desktop (ARD) for Mac OS X 10.2.8 and later does not drop privileges on the remote machine while installing certain applications, which allows local users to bypass authentication and gain privileges by selecting the icon during installation.  NOTE: it could be argued that the issue is not in Remote Desktop itself, but in applications that are installed while using it.",
