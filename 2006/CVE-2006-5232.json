			"text": "** DISPUTED **\n\nMultiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in iSearch 2.16 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the isearch_path parameter in (1) index.php, (2) viewcache.php, (3) sitemap.php, (4) isearch.inc.php, (5) google_sitemap.php, (6) stats.php, or (7) auto_spider_img.php.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by a third party who shows that $isearch_path is set to a constant value.  CVE analysis as of 20061010 is inconclusive, although the original researcher is known to make mistakes."
