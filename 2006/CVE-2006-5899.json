    "description": "** DISPUTED **\n\nPHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in install.php3 in @cid stats 2.3 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the repertoire parameter.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by a third party, who states that install.php3 is supposed to be deleted after installation and, if not deleted, intentionally allows setting repertoire without an inclusion attack.",
