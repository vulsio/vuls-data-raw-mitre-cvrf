    "description": "** DISPUTED **\n\nBuffer overflow in the SMB_Connect_Server function in FreeRadius 1.1.3 and earlier allows attackers to execute arbitrary code related to the server desthost field of an SMB_Handle_Type instance.  NOTE: the impact of this issue has been disputed by a reliable third party and the vendor, who states that exploitation is limited \"only to local administrators who have write access to the server configuration files.\"  CVE concurs with the dispute.",
