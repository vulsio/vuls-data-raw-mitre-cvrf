		"description": "** DISPUTED **\n\nUnspecified vulnerability in the grsecurity patch has unspecified impact and remote attack vectors, a different vulnerability than the expand_stack vulnerability from the Digital Armaments 20070110 pre-advisory.  NOTE: the grsecurity developer has disputed this issue, stating that \"the function they claim the vulnerability to be in is a trivial function, which can, and has been, easily checked for any supposed vulnerabilities.\"  The developer also cites a past disclosure that was not proven.",
