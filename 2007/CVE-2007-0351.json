	"notes": {
		"description": "Microsoft Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 do not properly handle user logoff, which might allow local users to gain the privileges of a previous system user, possibly related to user profile unload failure. NOTE: it is not clear whether this is an issue in Windows itself, or an interaction with another product.  The issue might involve ZoneAlarm not being able to terminate processes when it cannot prompt the user.",
