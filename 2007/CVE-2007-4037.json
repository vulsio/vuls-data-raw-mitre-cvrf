		"description": "** DISPUTED **\n\nGuidance Software EnCase allows user-assisted attackers to trigger a buffer over-read and application crash via a malformed NTFS filesystem containing a modified FILE record with a certain large offset. NOTE: the vendor disputes the significance of this issue, asserting that relevant attackers typically do not corrupt a filesystem, and indicating that the relevant read operation can be disabled.",
