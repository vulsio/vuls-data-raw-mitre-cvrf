		"description": "The Visionsoft Audit on Demand Service (VSAOD) in Visionsoft Audit 12.4.0.0 does not require authentication for (1) the \"LOG.\" command, which allows remote attackers to create or overwrite arbitrary files; (2) the SETTINGSFILE command, which allows remote attackers to overwrite the ini file, and reconfigure VSAOD or cause a denial of service; or (3) the UNINSTALL command, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon shutdown).  NOTE: vector 1 can be leveraged for code execution by writing to a Startup folder.",
