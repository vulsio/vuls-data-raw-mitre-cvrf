    "description": "The driver for the Linksys WRT350N Wi-Fi access point with firmware 2.00.17 on the Atheros AR5416-AC1E chipset does not properly parse the Atheros vendor-specific information element in an association request, which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (device reboot or hang) or possibly execute arbitrary code via an Atheros information element with an invalid length, as demonstrated by an element that is too long.",
