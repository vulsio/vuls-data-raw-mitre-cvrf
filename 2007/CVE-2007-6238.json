    "description": "Unspecified vulnerability in Apple QuickTime 7.2 on Windows XP allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via unknown attack vectors, probably a different vulnerability than CVE-2007-6166.  NOTE: this information is based upon a vague advisory by a vulnerability information sales organization that does not coordinate with vendors or release advisories with actionable information.  A CVE has been assigned for tracking purposes, but duplicates with other CVEs are difficult to determine.  However, the organization has stated that this is different than CVE-2007-6166.",
