NOTE: Red Hat has disputed the vulnerability, stating \"The Red Hat Security Response Team have been unable to confirm the existence of this format string vulnerability in the toolkit, and the sample published exploit is not complete or functional.\"  CVE agrees that the exploit contains syntax errors and uses Unix-only include files while invoking Windows functions.",
