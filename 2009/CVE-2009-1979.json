    "description": "Unspecified vulnerability in the Network Authentication component in Oracle Database 10.1.0.5 and 10.2.0.4 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors.  NOTE: the previous information was obtained from the October 2009 CPU.  Oracle has not commented on claims from an independent researcher that this is related to improper validation of the AUTH_SESSKEY parameter length that leads to arbitrary code execution.",
