		"description": "The x86 emulator in KVM 83, when a guest is configured for Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP), does not properly restrict writing of segment selectors to segment registers, which might allow guest OS users to cause a denial of service (guest OS crash) or gain privileges on the guest OS by leveraging access to a (1) IO port or (2) MMIO region, and replacing an instruction in between emulator entry and instruction fetch.",
