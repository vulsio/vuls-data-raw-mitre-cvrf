	"notes": {
		"description": "The design of the dialplan functionality in Asterisk Open Source 1.2.x, 1.4.x, and 1.6.x; and Asterisk Business Edition B.x.x and C.x.x, when using the ${EXTEN} channel variable and wildcard pattern matches, allows context-dependent attackers to inject strings into the dialplan using metacharacters that are injected when the variable is expanded, as demonstrated using the Dial application to process a crafted SIP INVITE message that adds an unintended outgoing channel leg.  NOTE: it could be argued that this is not a vulnerability in Asterisk, but a class of vulnerabilities that can occur in any program that uses this feature without the associated filtering functionality that is already available.",
