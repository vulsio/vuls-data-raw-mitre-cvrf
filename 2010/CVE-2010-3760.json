    "description": "FastBackMount.exe in the Mount service in IBM Tivoli Storage Manager (TSM) FastBack 5.5.0.0 through 5.5.6.0 and 6.1.0.0 through 6.1.0.1 does not properly handle a certain failure to allocate memory, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash, and recovery failure) by specifying a large size value within TCP packet data.  NOTE: this might overlap CVE-2010-3061.",
