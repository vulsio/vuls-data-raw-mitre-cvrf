    "description": "Microsoft Windows 2008, 7, Vista, 2003, 2000, and XP, when using IPv6, allows remote attackers to determine whether a host is sniffing the network by sending an ICMPv6 Echo Request to a multicast address and determining whether an Echo Reply is sent, as demonstrated by thcping. NOTE: due to a typo, some sources map CVE-2010-4562 to a ProFTPd mod_sql vulnerability, but that issue is covered by CVE-2010-4652.",
