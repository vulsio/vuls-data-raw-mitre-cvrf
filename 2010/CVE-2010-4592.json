    "description": "The Mobile Network Connections functionality in the Connection Manager in IBM Lotus Mobile Connect before 6.1.4, when HTTP Access Services (HTTP-AS) is enabled, does not properly handle failed attempts at establishing HTTP-TCP sessions, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption and daemon crash) by making many TCP connection attempts.",
