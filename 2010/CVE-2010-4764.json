    "description": "Open Ticket Request System (OTRS) before 2.4.10, and 3.x before 3.0.3, does not present warnings about incoming encrypted e-mail messages that were based on revoked PGP or GPG keys, which makes it easier for remote attackers to spoof e-mail communication by leveraging a key that has a revocation signature.",
