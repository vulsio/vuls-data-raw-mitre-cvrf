    "description": "A DOM based cross-site scripting flaw was found in the JBoss Application Server 7 before 7.1.0 Beta 1 administration console. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted web page and trick the valid JBoss AS user, with the administrator privilege, to visit it, which would lead into the DOM environment modification and arbitrary HTML or web script execution.",
