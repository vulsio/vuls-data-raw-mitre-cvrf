    "description": "** DISPUTED ** McAfee Web Gateway 7.0 allows remote attackers to bypass the access configuration for the CONNECT method by providing an arbitrary allowed hostname in the Host HTTP header.  NOTE: this issue might not be reproducible, because the researcher did not provide configuration details for the vulnerable system, and the observed behavior might be consistent with a configuration that was (perhaps inadvertently) designed to allow access based on Host HTTP headers.",
