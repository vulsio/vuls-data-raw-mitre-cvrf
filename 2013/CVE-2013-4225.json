		"description": "The RESTful Web Services (restws) module 7.x-1.x before 7.x-1.4 and 7.x-2.x before 7.x-2.1 for Drupal does not properly restrict access to entity write operations, which makes it easier for remote authenticated users with the \"access resource node\" and \"create page content\" permissions (or equivalents) to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) or execute arbitrary PHP code via a crafted text field.",
