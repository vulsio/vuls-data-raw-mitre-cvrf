			"type": "Description",
			"text": "The ASUS WL-330NUL router has a configuration process that relies on accessing the 192.168.1.1 IP address, but the documentation advises users to instead access a DNS hostname that does not always resolve to 192.168.1.1, which makes it easier for remote attackers to hijack the configuration traffic by controlling the server associated with that hostname."
