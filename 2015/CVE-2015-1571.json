		"description": "** DISPUTED ** The CAPWAP DTLS protocol implementation in Fortinet FortiOS 5.0 Patch 7 build 4457 uses the same certificate and private key across different customers' installations, which makes it easier for man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers by leveraging the Fortinet_Factory certificate and private key.  NOTE: FG-IR-15-002 says \"The Fortinet_Factory certificate is unique to each device ... An attacker cannot therefore stage a MitM attack.\"",
