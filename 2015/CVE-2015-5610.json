    "description": "The RSM (aka RSMWinService) service in SolarWinds N-Able N-Central before 9.5.1.4514 uses the same password decryption key across different customers' installations, which makes it easier for remote authenticated users to obtain the cleartext domain-administrator password by locating the encrypted password within HTML source code and then leveraging knowledge of this key from another installation.",
