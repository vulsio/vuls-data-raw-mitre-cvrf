			"type": "Description",
			"text": "Android 6.0 has an authentication bypass for attackers with root and physical access. Cryptographic authentication tokens (AuthTokens) used by the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) are protected by a weak challenge. This allows adversaries to replay previously captured responses and use the TEE without authenticating. All apps using authentication-gated cryptography are vulnerable to this attack, which was confirmed on the LG Nexus 5X."
