    "description": "The Apache HTTP Server in Apple OS X before 10.12 and OS X Server before 5.2 follows RFC 3875 section 4.1.18 and therefore does not protect applications from the presence of untrusted CGI client data in the HTTP_PROXY environment variable, which might allow remote attackers to redirect an application's outbound HTTP traffic to an arbitrary proxy server via a crafted Proxy header in an HTTP request, aka an \"httpoxy\" issue, a related issue to CVE-2016-5387.",
