    "description": "The firmware in Lenovo Ultraslim dongles, as used with Lenovo Liteon SK-8861, Ultraslim Wireless, and Silver Silk keyboards and Liteon ZTM600 and Ultraslim Wireless mice, does not enforce incrementing AES counters, which allows remote attackers to inject encrypted keyboard input into the system by leveraging proximity to the dongle, aka a \"KeyJack injection attack.\"",
