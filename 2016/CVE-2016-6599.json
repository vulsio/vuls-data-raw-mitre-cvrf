		"description": "BMC Track-It! 11.4 before Hotfix 3 exposes an unauthenticated .NET remoting configuration service (ConfigurationService) on port 9010. This service contains a method that can be used to retrieve a configuration file that contains the application database name, username and password as well as the domain administrator username and password. These are encrypted with a fixed key and IV (\"NumaraIT\") using the DES algorithm. The domain administrator username and password can only be obtained if the Self-Service component is enabled, which is the most common scenario in enterprise deployments.",
