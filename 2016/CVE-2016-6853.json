    "description": "An issue was discovered in Open-Xchange OX Guard before 2.4.2-rev5. Script code and references to external websites can be injected to the names of PGP public keys. When requesting that key later on using a specific URL, such script code might get executed. In case of injecting external websites, users might get lured into a phishing scheme. Malicious script code can be executed within a user's context. This can lead to session hijacking or triggering unwanted actions via the web interface (sending mail, deleting data etc.).",
