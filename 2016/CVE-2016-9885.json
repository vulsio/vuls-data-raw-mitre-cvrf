	"notes": {
		"description": "An issue was discovered in Pivotal GemFire for PCF 1.6.x versions prior to 1.6.5 and 1.7.x versions prior to 1.7.1. The gfsh (Geode Shell) endpoint, used by operators and application developers to connect to their cluster, is unauthenticated and publicly accessible. Because HTTPS communications are terminated at the gorouter, communications from the gorouter to GemFire clusters are unencrypted. An attacker could run any command available on gfsh and could cause denial of service, lost confidentiality of data, escalate privileges, or eavesdrop on other communications between the gorouter and the cluster.",
