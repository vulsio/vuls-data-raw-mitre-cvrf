		"description": "Some URLs provided by Jenkins global-build-stats plugin version 1.4 and earlier returned a JSON response that contained request parameters. These responses had the Content Type: text/html, so could have been interpreted as HTML by clients, resulting in a potential reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability. Additionally, some URLs provided by global-build-stats plugin that modify data did not require POST requests to be sent, resulting in a potential cross-site request forgery vulnerability.",
