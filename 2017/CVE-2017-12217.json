			"type": "Description",
			"text": "A vulnerability in the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) Tunneling Protocol ingress packet handler of Cisco ASR 5500 System Architecture Evolution (SAE) Gateways could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a partial denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper input validation of GPRS Tunneling Protocol packet headers. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed GPRS Tunneling Protocol packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the GTPUMGR process on an affected device to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a partial DoS condition. If the GTPUMGR process restarts, there could be a brief impact on traffic passing through the device. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve07119."
