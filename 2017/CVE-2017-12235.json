  "notes": {
    "description": "A vulnerability in the implementation of the PROFINET Discovery and Configuration Protocol (PN-DCP) for Cisco IOS 12.2 through 15.6 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to the improper parsing of ingress PN-DCP Identify Request packets destined to an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted PN-DCP Identify Request packet to an affected device and then continuing to send normal PN-DCP Identify Request packets to the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. This vulnerability affects Cisco devices that are configured to process PROFINET messages. Beginning with Cisco IOS Software Release 12.2(52)SE, PROFINET is enabled by default on all the base switch module and expansion-unit Ethernet ports. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCuz47179.",
