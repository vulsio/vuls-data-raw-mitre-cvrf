The vulnerability is due to a lack of input- and validation-checking mechanisms in the system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing specific commands after authenticating to the system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view profile information where only certain parameters should be visible. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve14401."
