		{
			"type": "Description",
			"text": "A vulnerability in conditional, verbose debug logging for the IPsec feature of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to display sensitive IPsec information in the system log file. The vulnerability is due to incorrect implementation of IPsec conditional, verbose debug logging that causes sensitive information to be written to the log file. This information should be restricted. An attacker who has valid administrative credentials could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device and enabling conditional, verbose debug logging for IPsec and viewing the log file. An exploit could allow the attacker to access sensitive information related to the IPsec configuration. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf12081."
