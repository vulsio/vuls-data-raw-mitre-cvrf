		"description": "In Foxit Reader before 9.1 and Foxit PhantomPDF before 9.1, a flaw exists within the parsing of the BITMAPINFOHEADER record in BMP files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the biSize member, which can result in a heap based buffer overflow. An attacker can leverage this to execute code in the context of the current process.",
