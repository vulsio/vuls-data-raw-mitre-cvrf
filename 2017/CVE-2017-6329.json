			"type": "Description",
			"text": "Symantec VIP Access for Desktop prior to 2.2.4 can be susceptible to a DLL Pre-Loading vulnerability. These types of issues occur when an application looks to call a DLL for execution and an attacker provides a malicious DLL to use instead. Depending on how the application is configured, the application will generally follow a specific search path to locate the DLL. The exploitation of the vulnerability manifests as a simple file write (or potentially an over-write) which results in a foreign executable running under the context of the application."
