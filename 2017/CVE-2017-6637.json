		{
			"type": "Description",
			"text": "A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning Software (prior to Release 11.1) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to delete any file from an affected system. The vulnerability exists because the affected software does not perform proper input validation of HTTP requests and fails to apply role-based access controls (RBACs) to requested HTTP URLs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request that uses directory traversal techniques to submit a path to a desired file location on an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to delete any file from the system. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc99618."
