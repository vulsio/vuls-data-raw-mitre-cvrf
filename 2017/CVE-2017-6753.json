This vulnerability affects the browser extensions for Cisco WebEx Meetings Server, Cisco WebEx Centers (Meeting Center, Event Center, Training Center, and Support Center), and Cisco WebEx Meetings when they are running on Microsoft Windows. The vulnerability is due to a design defect in the extension.

If successful, the attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the affected browser. The following versions of the Cisco WebEx browser extensions are affected: Versions prior to 1.0.12 of the Cisco WebEx extension on Google Chrome, Versions prior to 1.0.12 of the Cisco WebEx extension on Mozilla Firefox.
