    "description": "OpenText Documentum Content Server has an inadequate protection mechanism against SQL injection, which allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary code with super-user privileges by leveraging the availability of the dm_bp_transition docbase method with a user-created dm_procedure object, as demonstrated by use of a backspace character in an injected string. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-2513.",
