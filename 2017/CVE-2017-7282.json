		"description": "An issue was discovered in Unitrends Enterprise Backup before 9.1.1. The function downloadFile in api/includes/restore.php blindly accepts any filename passed to /api/restore/download as valid. This allows an authenticated attacker to read any file in the filesystem that the web server has access to, aka Local File Inclusion (LFI).",
