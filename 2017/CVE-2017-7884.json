		"description": "In Adam Kropelin adk0212 APC UPS Daemon through 3.14.14, the default installation of APCUPSD allows a local authenticated, but unprivileged, user to run arbitrary code with elevated privileges by replacing the service executable apcupsd.exe with a malicious executable that will run with SYSTEM privileges at startup. This occurs because of \"RW NT AUTHORITY\\Authenticated Users\" permissions for %SYSTEMDRIVE%\\apcupsd\\bin\\apcupsd.exe.",
