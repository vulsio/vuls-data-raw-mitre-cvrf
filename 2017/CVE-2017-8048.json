    "description": "In Cloud Foundry capi-release versions 1.33.0 and later, prior to 1.42.0 and cf-release versions 268 and later, prior to 274, the original fix for CVE-2017-8033 introduces an API regression that allows a space developer to execute arbitrary code on the Cloud Controller VM by pushing a specially crafted application.
