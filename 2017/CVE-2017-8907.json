			"type": "Description",
			"text": "Atlassian Bamboo 5.x before 5.15.7 and 6.x before 6.0.1 did not correctly check if a user creating a deployment project had the edit permission and therefore the rights to do so.  An attacker who can login to Bamboo as a user without the edit permission for deployment projects is able to use this vulnerability, provided there is an existing plan with a green build, to create a deployment project and execute arbitrary code on an available Bamboo Agent.  By default a local agent is enabled; this means that code execution can occur on the system hosting Bamboo as the user running Bamboo."
