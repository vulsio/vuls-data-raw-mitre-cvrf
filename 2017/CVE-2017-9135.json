    "description": "An issue was discovered on Mimosa Client Radios before 2.2.4 and Mimosa Backhaul Radios before 2.2.4. On the backend of the device's web interface, there are some diagnostic tests available that are not displayed on the webpage; these are only accessible by crafting a POST request with a program like cURL. There is one test accessible via cURL that does not properly sanitize user input, allowing an attacker to execute shell commands as the root user.",
