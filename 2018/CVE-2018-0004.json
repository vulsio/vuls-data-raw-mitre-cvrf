		{
			"type": "Description",
			"text": "A sustained sequence of different types of normal transit traffic can trigger a high CPU consumption denial of service condition in the Junos OS register and schedule software interrupt handler subsystem when a specific command is issued to the device. This affects one or more threads and conversely one or more running processes running on the system. Once this occurs, the high CPU event(s) affects either or both the forwarding and control plane. As a result of this condition the device can become inaccessible in either or both the control and forwarding plane and stops forwarding traffic until the device is rebooted. The issue will reoccur after reboot upon receiving further transit traffic. Score: 5.7 MEDIUM (CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) For network designs utilizing layer 3 forwarding agents or other ARP through layer 3 technologies, the score is slightly higher. Score: 6.5 MEDIUM (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) If the following entry exists in the RE message logs then this may indicate the issue is present. This entry may or may not appear when this issue occurs. /kernel: Expensive timeout(9) function: Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS: 12.1X46 versions prior to 12.1X46-D50; 12.3X48 versions prior to 12.3X48-D30; 12.3R versions prior to 12.3R12-S7; 14.1 versions prior to 14.1R8-S4, 14.1R9; 14.1X53 versions prior to 14.1X53-D30, 14.1X53-D34; 14.2 versions prior to 14.2R8; 15.1 versions prior to 15.1F6, 15.1R3; 15.1X49 versions prior to 15.1X49-D40; 15.1X53 versions prior to 15.1X53-D31, 15.1X53-D33, 15.1X53-D60.
