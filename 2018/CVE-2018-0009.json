		"description": "On Juniper Networks SRX series devices, firewall rules configured to match custom application UUIDs starting with zeros can match all TCP traffic. Due to this issue, traffic that should have been blocked by other rules is permitted to flow through the device resulting in a firewall bypass condition. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS: 12.1X46 versions prior to 12.1X46-D71 on SRX series; 12.3X48 versions prior to 12.3X48-D55 on SRX series; 15.1X49 versions prior to 15.1X49-D100 on SRX series.",
