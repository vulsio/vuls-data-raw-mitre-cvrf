			"type": "Description",
			"text": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco WAP150 Wireless-AC/N Dual Radio Access Point with Power over Ethernet (PoE) and WAP361 Wireless-AC/N Dual Radio Wall Plate Access Point with PoE could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface of an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve57076."
