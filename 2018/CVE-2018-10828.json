    "description": "An issue was discovered in Alps Pointing-device Driver 10.1.101.207. ApMsgFwd.exe allows the current user to map and write to the \"ApMsgFwd File Mapping Object\" section. ApMsgFwd.exe uses the data written to this section as arguments to functions. This causes a denial of service condition when invalid pointers are written to the mapped section. This driver has been used with Dell, ThinkPad, and VAIO devices.",
