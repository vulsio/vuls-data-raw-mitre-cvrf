		"description": "A vulnerability has been identified in SIMATIC STEP 7 (TIA Portal) and WinCC (TIA Portal) V10, V11, V12 (All versions), SIMATIC STEP 7 (TIA Portal) and WinCC (TIA Portal) V13 (All versions < V13 SP2 Update 2), SIMATIC STEP 7 (TIA Portal) and WinCC (TIA Portal) V14 (All versions < V14 SP1 Update 6), SIMATIC STEP 7 (TIA Portal) and WinCC (TIA Portal) V15 (All versions < V15 Update 2). Improper file permissions in the default installation of TIA Portal may allow an attacker with local file system access to insert specially crafted files which may prevent TIA Portal startup (Denial-of-Service) or lead to local code execution. No special privileges are required, but the victim needs to attempt to start TIA Portal after the manipulation.",
