    "description": "An issue was discovered in CapMon Access Manager 5.4.1.1005. CALRunElevated.exe attempts to enforce access control by adding an unprivileged user to the local Administrators group for a very short time to execute a single command. However, the user is left in that group if the command crashes, and there is also a race condition in all cases.",
