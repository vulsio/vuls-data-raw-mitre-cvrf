It has an upload feature that allows an authenticated user with the administrator role to upload arbitrary files to the main website directory. Exploitation involves uploading a \".php\" file within a \".zip\" file because a ZIP archive is accepted by /admin/?req=modules&action=add as a plugin, and extracted to the main directory. In order for the \".zip\" file to be accepted, it must also contain a package.json file."
