    "description": "An exploitable use of an uninitialized pointer vulnerability exists in the JavaScript engine in Foxit PDF Reader version 9.0.1.1049. A specially crafted PDF document can lead to a dereference of an uninitialized pointer which, if under attacker control, can result in arbitrary code execution. An attacker needs to trick the user to open a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability. If the browser plugin extension is enabled, visiting a malicious site can also trigger the vulnerability.",
