	"notes": {
		"description": "On Samsung SmartThings Hub STH-ETH-250 devices with firmware version 0.20.17, the video-core process insecurely extracts the fields from the \"shard\" table of its SQLite database, leading to a buffer overflow on the stack. The strcpy call overflows the destination buffer, which has a size of 128 bytes. An attacker can send an arbitrarily long \"secretKey\" value in order to exploit this vulnerability.",
