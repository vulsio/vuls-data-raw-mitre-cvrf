    "description": "** DISPUTED ** Kentico 9.0 through 11.0 has a stack-based buffer overflow via the SqlName, SqlPswd, Database, UserName, or Password field in a SilentInstall XML document. NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue because neither a buffer overflow nor a crash can be reproduced; also, reading XML documents is implemented exclusively with managed code within the Microsoft .NET Framework.",
