  "notes": {
    "description": "On BIG-IP 13.1.0-13.1.0.7, a remote attacker using undisclosed methods against virtual servers configured with a Client SSL or Server SSL profile that has the SSL Forward Proxy feature enabled can force the Traffic Management Microkernel (tmm) to leak memory. As a result, system memory usage increases over time, which may eventually cause a decrease in performance or a system reboot due to memory exhaustion.",
