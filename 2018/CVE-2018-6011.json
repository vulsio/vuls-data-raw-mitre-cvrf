			"type": "Description",
			"text": "The time-based one-time-password (TOTP) function in the application logic of the Green Electronics RainMachine Mini-8 (2nd generation) uses the administrator's password hash to generate a 6-digit temporary passcode that can be used for remote and local access, aka a \"Use of Password Hash Instead of Password for Authentication\" issue. This is exploitable by an attacker who discovers a hash value in the rainmachine-settings.sqlite file."
