    "description": "An issue was discovered that affects all producers of BIOS firmware who make a certain realistic interpretation of an obscure portion of the Trusted Computing Group (TCG) Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 specification. An abnormal case is not handled properly by this firmware while S3 sleep and can clear TPM 2.0. It allows local users to overwrite static PCRs of TPM and neutralize the security features of it, such as seal/unseal and remote attestation.",
