    "description": "Huawei home gateway products HiRouter-CD20 and WS5200 with the versions before HiRouter-CD20-10 1.9.6 and the versions before WS5200-10 1.9.6 have a path traversal vulnerability. Due to the lack of validation while these home gateway products install APK plugins, an attacker tricks a user into installing a malicious APK plugin, and plugin can overwrite arbitrary file of devices. Successful exploit may result in arbitrary code execution or privilege escalation.",
