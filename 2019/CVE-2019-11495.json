  "notes": {
    "description": "In Couchbase Server 5.1.1, the cookie used for intra-node communication was not generated securely. Couchbase Server uses erlang:now() to seed the PRNG which results in a small search space for potential random seeds that could then be used to brute force the cookie and execute code against a remote system. This has been fixed in version 6.0.0.",
