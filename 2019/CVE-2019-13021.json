		"description": "The administrative passwords for all versions of Bond JetSelect are stored within an unprotected file on the filesystem, rather than encrypted within the MySQL database. This backup copy of the passwords is made as part of the installation script, after the administrator has generated a password using ENCtool.jar (see CVE-2019-13022). This allows any low-privilege user who can read this file to trivially obtain the passwords for the administrative accounts of the JetSelect application. The path to the file containing the encoded password hash is /opt/JetSelect/SFC/resources/sfc-general-properties.",
