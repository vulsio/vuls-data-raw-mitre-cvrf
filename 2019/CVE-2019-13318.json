    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Foxit Reader 9.5.0.20723. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the processing of the util.printf Javascript method.
