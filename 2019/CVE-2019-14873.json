    "description": "In the __multadd function of the newlib libc library, prior to versions 3.3.0 (see newlib/libc/stdlib/mprec.c), Balloc is used to allocate a big integer, however no check is performed to verify if the allocation succeeded or not. This will trigger a null pointer dereference bug in case of a memory allocation failure.",
