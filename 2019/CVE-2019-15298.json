			"text": "A problem was found in Centreon Web through 19.04.3. An authenticated command injection is present in the page include/configuration/configObject/traps-mibs/formMibs.php. This page is called from the Centreon administration interface. This is the mibs management feature that contains a file filing form. At the time of submission of a file, the mnftr parameter is sent to the page and is not filtered properly. This allows one to inject Linux commands directly."
