    "description": "The KSLABS KSWEB (aka ru.kslabs.ksweb) application 3.93 for Android allows authenticated remote code execution via a POST request to the AJAX handler with the configFile parameter set to the arbitrary file to be written to (and the config_text parameter set to the content of the file to be created). This can be a PHP file that is written to in the public web directory and subsequently executed. The attacker must have network connectivity to the PHP server that is running on the Android device.",
