		"description": "An issue was discovered in Varnish Cache before 6.0.4 LTS, and 6.1.x and 6.2.x before 6.2.1. An HTTP/1 parsing failure allows a remote attacker to trigger an assert by sending crafted HTTP/1 requests. The assert will cause an automatic restart with a clean cache, which makes it a Denial of Service attack.",
