  "notes": {
    "description": "A vulnerability in the Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) of Cisco Integrated Management Controller (IMC) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to inject arbitrary commands that are executed with root privileges on the underlying operating system (OS). The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of user-supplied commands. An attacker who has administrator privileges and access to the network where the IPMI resides could exploit this vulnerability by submitting crafted input to the affected commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain root privileges on the affected device.",
