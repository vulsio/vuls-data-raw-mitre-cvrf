    "description": "** DISPUTED ** PEGA Platform 8.3.0 is vulnerable to a direct prweb/sso/random_token/!STANDARD?pyActivity=Data-Admin-DB-Name.DBSchema_ListDatabases request while using a low-privilege account. (This can perform actions and retrieve data that only an administrator should have access to.) NOTE: The vendor states that this vulnerability was discovered using an administrator account and they are normal administrator functions. Therefore, the claim that the CVE was done with a low privilege account is incorrect.",
