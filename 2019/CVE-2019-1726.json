  "notes": {
    "description": "A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to access internal services that should be restricted on an affected device, such as the NX-API. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of arguments passed to a certain CLI command. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by including malicious input as the argument to the affected command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass intended restrictions and access internal services of the device. An attacker would need valid device credentials to exploit this vulnerability.",
