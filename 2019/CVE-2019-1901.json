		"description": "A vulnerability in the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) subsystem of Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) Mode Switch Software could allow an adjacent, unauthenticated attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition or execute arbitrary code with root privileges. The vulnerability is due to improper input validation of certain type, length, value (TLV) fields of the LLDP frame header. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted LLDP packet to the targeted device. A successful exploit may lead to a buffer overflow condition that could either cause a DoS condition or allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges. Note: This vulnerability cannot be exploited by transit traffic through the device; the crafted packet must be targeted to a directly connected interface. This vulnerability affects Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in ACI mode if they are running a Cisco Nexus 9000 Series ACI Mode Switch Software release prior to 13.2(7f) or any 14.x release.",
