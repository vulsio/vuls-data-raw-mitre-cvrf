    "description": "Embedthis GoAhead before 5.0.1 mishandles redirected HTTP requests with a large Host header. The GoAhead WebsRedirect uses a static host buffer that has a limited length and can overflow. This can cause a copy of the Host header to fail, leaving that buffer uninitialized, which may leak uninitialized data in a response.",
