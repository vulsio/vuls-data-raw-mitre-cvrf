To exploit the vulnerability, someone must have Admin access to the Centreon Web Interface and create a custom main.php?p=60803&type=3 command. The user must then set the Pollers Post-Restart Command to this previously created command via the main.php?p=60901&o=c&server_id=1 URI. This is triggered via an export of the Poller Configuration.",
