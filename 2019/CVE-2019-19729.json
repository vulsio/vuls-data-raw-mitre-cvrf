  "notes": {
    "description": "An issue was discovered in the BSON ObjectID (aka bson-objectid) package 1.3.0 for Node.js. ObjectID() allows an attacker to generate a malformed objectid by inserting an additional property to the user-input, because bson-objectid will return early if it detects _bsontype==ObjectID in the user-input object. As a result, objects in arbitrary forms can bypass formatting if they have a valid bsontype.",
