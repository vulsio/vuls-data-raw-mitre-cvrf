			"type": "Description",
			"text": "An issue was discovered on NETGEAR WNR1000V4 1.1.0.54 devices. The web management interface (setup.cgi) has an authentication bypass and other problems that ultimately allow an attacker to remotely compromise the device from a malicious webpage. The attacker sends an FW_remote.htm&todo=cfg_init request without a cookie, reads the Set-Cookie header in the 401 Unauthorized response, and then repeats the FW_remote.htm&todo=cfg_init request with the specified cookie."
