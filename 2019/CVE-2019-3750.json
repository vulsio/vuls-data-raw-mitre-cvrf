A local authenticated malicious user with low privileges potentially could exploit this vulnerability to delete arbitrary files by creating a symlink from the \"Temp\\IC\\ICDebugLog.txt\" to any targeted file. This issue occurs because of insecure handling of Temp directory permissions that were set incorrectly.",
