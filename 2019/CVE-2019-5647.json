		"description": "The Chrome Plugin for Rapid7 AppSpider can incorrectly keep browser sessions active after recording a macro, even after a restart of the Chrome browser. This behavior could make future session hijacking attempts easier, since the user could believe a session was closed when it was not. This issue affects Rapid7 AppSpider version 3.8.213 and prior versions, and is fixed in version 3.8.215.",
