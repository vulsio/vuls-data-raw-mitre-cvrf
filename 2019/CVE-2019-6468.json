    "description": "In BIND Supported Preview Edition, an error in the nxdomain-redirect feature can occur in versions which support EDNS Client Subnet (ECS) features. In those versions which have ECS support, enabling nxdomain-redirect is likely to lead to BIND exiting due to assertion failure. Versions affected: BIND Supported Preview Edition version 9.10.5-S1 -> 9.11.5-S5. ONLY BIND Supported Preview Edition releases are affected.",
