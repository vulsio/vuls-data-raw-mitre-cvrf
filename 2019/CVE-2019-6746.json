			"type": "Description",
			"text": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on vulnerable installations of Foxit Studio Photo 3.6.6. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the handling of TIF files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated structure. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-7634."
