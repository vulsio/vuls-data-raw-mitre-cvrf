    "description": "Kibana versions before 6.6.1 contain an arbitrary code execution flaw in the security audit logger. If a Kibana instance has the setting xpack.security.audit.enabled set to true, an attacker could send a request that will attempt to execute javascript code. This could possibly lead to an attacker executing arbitrary commands with permissions of the Kibana process on the host system.",
