		"description": "A privilege escalation vulnerability in Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.0 and earlier allows any unprivileged Linux user to escalate privileges to root. The installer sets too relaxed permissions on /usr/local/WowzaStreamingEngine/bin/* core program files. By injecting a payload into one of those files, it will run with the same privileges as the Wowza server, root. For example, /usr/local/WowzaStreamingEngine/bin/tune.sh could be replaced with a Trojan horse. This issue was resolved in Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.5.",
