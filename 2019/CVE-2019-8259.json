		"description": "UltraVNC revision 1198 contains multiple memory leaks (CWE-655) in VNC client code, which allow an attacker to read stack memory and can be abused for information disclosure. Combined with another vulnerability, it can be used to leak stack memory and bypass ASLR. This attack appears to be exploitable via network connectivity.
