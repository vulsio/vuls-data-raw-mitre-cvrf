		"description": "** DISPUTED ** scikit-learn (aka sklearn) through 0.23.0 can unserialize and execute commands from an untrusted file that is passed to the joblib.load() function, if __reduce__ makes an os.system call. NOTE: third parties dispute this issue because the joblib.load() function is documented as unsafe and it is the user's responsibility to use the function in a secure manner.",
