An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code with elevated system privileges. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p> <p>To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to log on to an affected system and run a specially crafted script or application.</p> <p>The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows Print Spooler Component writes to the file system.</p>",
