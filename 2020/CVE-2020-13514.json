A specially crafted I/O request packet (IRP) can cause increased privileges. Using the IRP 0x9c40a0e0 gives a low privilege user direct access to the OUT instruction that is completely unrestrained at an elevated privilege level. An attacker can send a malicious IRP to trigger this vulnerability.",
