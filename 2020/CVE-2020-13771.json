  "notes": {
    "description": "Various components in Ivanti Endpoint Manager through 2020.1.1 rely on Windows search order when loading a (nonexistent) library file, allowing (under certain conditions) one to gain code execution (and elevation of privileges to the level of privilege held by the vulnerable component such as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM) via DLL hijacking. This affects ldiscn32.exe, IpmiRedirectionService.exe, LDAPWhoAmI.exe, and ldprofile.exe.",
