In October CMS from version 1.0.319 and before version 1.0.470, backend users with the default \"Publisher\" system role have access to create & manage users where they can choose which role the new user has. This means that a user with \"Publisher\" access has the ability to escalate their access to \"Developer\" access. Issue has been patched in Build 470 (v1.0.470) & v1.1.1."
