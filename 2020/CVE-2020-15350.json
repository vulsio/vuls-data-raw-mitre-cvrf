  "notes": {
    "description": "RIOT 2020.04 has a buffer overflow in the base64 decoder. The decoding function base64_decode() uses an output buffer estimation function to compute the required buffer capacity and validate against the provided buffer size. The base64_estimate_decode_size() function calculates the expected decoded size with an arithmetic round-off error and does not take into account possible padding bytes. Due to this underestimation, it may be possible to craft base64 input that causes a buffer overflow.",
