Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the Reporter_ImportLicense class. Due to the improper restriction of XML External Entity (XXE) references, a specially crafted document specifying a URI causes the XML parser to access the URI and embed the contents back into the XML document for further processing.
