			"type": "Description",
			"text": "A vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved may allow an attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by sending a high rate of specific packets to the device, resulting in a pfemand process crash. The pfemand process is responsible for packet forwarding on the device. By continuously sending the packet flood, an attacker can repeatedly crash the pfemand process causing a sustained Denial of Service. This issue can only be triggered by traffic sent to the device. Transit traffic does not cause this issue. This issue affects all version of Junos OS Evolved prior to 19.1R1-EVO."
