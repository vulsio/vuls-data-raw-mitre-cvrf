		"description": "<p>An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the Windows Installer when the Windows Installer fails to properly sanitize input leading to an insecure library loading behavior.</p> <p>A locally authenticated attacker could run arbitrary code with elevated system privileges. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p> <p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the input sanitization error to preclude unintended elevation.</p>",
