		"description": "An issue was discovered in HCC Embedded NicheStack IPv4 4.1. The dnc_copy_in routine for parsing DNS domain names does not check whether a domain name compression pointer is pointing within the bounds of the packet (e.g., forward compression pointer jumps are allowed), which leads to an Out-of-bounds Read, and a Denial-of-Service as a consequence.",
