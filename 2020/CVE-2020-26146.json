			"text": "An issue was discovered on Samsung Galaxy S3 i9305 4.4.4 devices. The WPA, WPA2, and WPA3 implementations reassemble fragments with non-consecutive packet numbers. An adversary can abuse this to exfiltrate selected fragments. This vulnerability is exploitable when another device sends fragmented frames and the WEP, CCMP, or GCMP data-confidentiality protocol is used. Note that WEP is vulnerable to this attack by design."
