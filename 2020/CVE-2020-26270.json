	"notes": {
		"description": "In affected versions of TensorFlow running an LSTM/GRU model where the LSTM/GRU layer receives an input with zero-length results in a CHECK failure when using the CUDA backend. This can result in a query-of-death vulnerability, via denial of service, if users can control the input to the layer. This is fixed in versions 1.15.5, 2.0.4, 2.1.3, 2.2.2, 2.3.2, and 2.4.0.",
