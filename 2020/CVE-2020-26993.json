    "description": "A vulnerability has been identified in JT2Go (All versions < V13.1.0), Teamcenter Visualization (All versions < V13.1.0). Affected applications lack proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing CGM files. This could lead to a stack based buffer overflow while trying to copy to a buffer in the font index handling function. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.",
