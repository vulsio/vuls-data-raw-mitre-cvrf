    "description": "A vulnerability has been identified in JT2Go (All versions < V13.1.0.1), Teamcenter Visualization (All versions < V13.1.0.1). Affected applications lack proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing TIFF files. This could lead to pointer dereferences of a value obtained from untrusted source.
