		"description": "A vulnerability has been identified in APOGEE PXC Compact (BACnet) (All versions < V3.5.5), APOGEE PXC Compact (P2 Ethernet) (All versions < V2.8.20), APOGEE PXC Modular (BACnet) (All versions < V3.5.5), APOGEE PXC Modular (P2 Ethernet) (All versions < V2.8.20), Nucleus NET (All versions < V5.2), Nucleus Source Code (Versions including affected DNS modules), TALON TC Compact (BACnet) (All versions < V3.5.5), TALON TC Modular (BACnet) (All versions < V3.5.5). The DNS domain name record decompression functionality does not properly validate the pointer offset values. The parsing of malformed responses could result in a write past the end of an allocated structure. An attacker with a privileged position in the network could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process or cause a denial-of-service condition.",
