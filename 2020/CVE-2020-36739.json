    "description": "The Feed Them Social â€“ Page, Post, Video, and Photo Galleries plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.8.6. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the my_fts_fb_load_more() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to load feeds via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
