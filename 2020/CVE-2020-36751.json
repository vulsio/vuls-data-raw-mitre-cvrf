    "description": "The Coupon Creator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the save_meta() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to save meta fields via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
