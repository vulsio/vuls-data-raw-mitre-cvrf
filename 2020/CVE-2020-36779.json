		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: i2c: stm32f7: fix reference leak when pm_runtime_get_sync fails The PM reference count is not expected to be incremented on return in these stm32f7_i2c_xx serious functions. However, pm_runtime_get_sync will increment the PM reference count even failed. Forgetting to putting operation will result in a reference leak here. Replace it with pm_runtime_resume_and_get to keep usage counter balanced.",
