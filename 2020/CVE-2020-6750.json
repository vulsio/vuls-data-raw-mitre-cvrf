	"notes": {
		"description": "GSocketClient in GNOME GLib through 2.62.4 may occasionally connect directly to a target address instead of connecting via a proxy server when configured to do so, because the proxy_addr field is mishandled. This bug is timing-dependent and may occur only sporadically depending on network delays. The greatest security relevance is in use cases where a proxy is used to help with privacy/anonymity, even though there is no technical barrier to a direct connection. NOTE: versions before 2.60 are unaffected.",
