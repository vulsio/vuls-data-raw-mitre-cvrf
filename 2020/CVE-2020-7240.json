			"text": "** DISPUTED ** Meinberg Lantime M300 and M1000 devices allow attackers (with privileges to configure a device) to execute arbitrary OS commands by editing the /config/netconf.cmd script (aka Extended Network Configuration). Note: According to the description, the vulnerability requires a fully authenticated super-user account using a webUI function that allows super users to edit a script supposed to execute OS commands. The given weakness enumeration (CWE-78) is not applicable in this case as it refers to abusing functions/input fields not supposed to be accepting OS commands by using 'Special Elements.'"
