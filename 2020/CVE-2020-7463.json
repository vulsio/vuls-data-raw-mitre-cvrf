    "description": "In FreeBSD 12.1-STABLE before r364644, 11.4-STABLE before r364651, 12.1-RELEASE before p9, 11.4-RELEASE before p3, and 11.3-RELEASE before p13, improper handling in the kernel causes a use-after-free bug by sending large user messages from multiple threads on the same SCTP socket. The use-after-free situation may result in unintended kernel behaviour including a kernel panic.",
