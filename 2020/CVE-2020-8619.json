    "description": "In ISC BIND9 versions BIND 9.11.14 -> 9.11.19, BIND 9.14.9 -> 9.14.12, BIND 9.16.0 -> 9.16.3, BIND Supported Preview Edition 9.11.14-S1 -> 9.11.19-S1: Unless a nameserver is providing authoritative service for one or more zones and at least one zone contains an empty non-terminal entry containing an asterisk (\"*\") character, this defect cannot be encountered. A would-be attacker who is allowed to change zone content could theoretically introduce such a record in order to exploit this condition to cause denial of service, though we consider the use of this vector unlikely because any such attack would require a significant privilege level and be easily traceable.",
