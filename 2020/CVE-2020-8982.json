		{
			"type": "Description",
			"text": "An unauthenticated arbitrary file read issue exists in all versions of Citrix ShareFile StorageZones (aka storage zones) Controller, including the most recent 5.10.x releases as of May 2020. RCE and file access is granted to everything hosted by ShareFile, be it on-premise or inside Citrix Cloud itself (both are internet facing). NOTE: unlike most CVEs, exploitability depends on the product version that was in use when a particular setup step was performed, NOT the product version that is in use during a current assessment of a CVE consumer's product inventory. Specifically, the vulnerability can be exploited if a storage zone was created by one of these product versions: 5.9.0, 5.8.0, 5.7.0, 5.6.0, 5.5.0, or earlier. This CVE differs from CVE-2020-7473 and CVE-2020-8983."
