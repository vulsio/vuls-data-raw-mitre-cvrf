		"description": "An issue was discovered in includes/head.inc.php in rConfig before 3.9.4. An unauthenticated attacker can retrieve saved cleartext credentials via a GET request to settings.php. Because the application was not exiting after a redirect is applied, the rest of the page still executed, resulting in the disclosure of cleartext credentials in the response.",
