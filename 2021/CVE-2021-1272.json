		"description": "A vulnerability in the session validation feature of Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass access controls and conduct a server-side request forgery (SSRF) attack on a targeted system. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of parameters in a specific HTTP request by an attacker. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an authenticated user of the DCNM web application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass access controls and gain unauthorized access to the Device Manager application, which provides access to network devices managed by the system.",
