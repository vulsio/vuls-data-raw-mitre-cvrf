  "notes": {
    "description": "A vulnerability in the change password API of Cisco Connected Mobile Experiences (CMX) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to alter their own password to a value that does not comply with the strong authentication requirements that are configured on an affected device. This vulnerability exists because a password policy check is incomplete at the time a password is changed at server side using the API. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted API request to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to change their own password to a value that does not comply with the configured strong authentication requirements.",
