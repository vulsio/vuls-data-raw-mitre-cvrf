			"type": "Description",
			"text": "A vulnerability in the implementation of the system login block-for command for Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a login process to unexpectedly restart, causing a denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability is due to a logic error in the implementation of the system login block-for command when an attack is detected and acted upon. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by performing a brute-force login attack on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a login process to reload, which could result in a delay during authentication to the affected device."
