		"description": "A locking protection bypass flaw was found in some versions of gnome-shell as shipped within CentOS Stream 8, when the \"Application menu\" or \"Window list\" GNOME extensions are enabled. This flaw allows a physical attacker who has access to a locked system to kill existing applications and start new ones as the locked user, even if the session is still locked.",
