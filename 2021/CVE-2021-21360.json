		"description": "Products.GenericSetup is a mini-framework for expressing the configured state of a Zope Site as a set of filesystem artifacts.

The problem has been fixed in version 2.1.1. Depending on how you have installed Products.GenericSetup, you should change the buildout version pin to 2.1.1 and re-run the buildout, or if you used pip simply do pip install `\"Products.GenericSetup>=2.1.1\"`.",
