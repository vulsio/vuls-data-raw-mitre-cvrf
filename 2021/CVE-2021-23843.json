			"type": "Description",
			"text": "The Bosch software tools AccessIPConfig.exe and AmcIpConfig.exe are used to configure certains settings in AMC2 devices. The tool allows putting a password protection on configured devices to restrict access to the configuration of an AMC2. An attacker can circumvent this protection and make unauthorized changes to configuration data on the device. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to manipulate the device\\'s configuration or make it unresponsive in the local network. The attacker needs to have access to the local network, typically even the same subnet."
