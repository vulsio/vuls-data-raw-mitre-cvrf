    "description": "The Smart Slider 3 Free and pro WordPress plugins before 3.5.0.9 did not sanitise the Project Name before outputting it back in the page, leading to a Stored Cross-Site Scripting issue. By default, only administrator users could access the affected functionality, limiting the exploitability of the vulnerability. However, some WordPress admins may allow lesser privileged users to access the plugin's functionality, in which case, privilege escalation could be performed.",
