    "description": "The ugeom2d.dll library in all versions of Solid Edge SE2020 before 2020MP14 and all versions of Solid Edge SE2021 before SE2021MP5 lack proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing DFT files. This could result in an out-of-bounds write past the end of an allocated structure. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.",
