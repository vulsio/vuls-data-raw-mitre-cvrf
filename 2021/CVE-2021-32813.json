		"description": "Traefik is an HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer. Prior to version 2.4.13, there exists a potential header vulnerability in Traefik's handling of the Connection header. Active exploitation of this issue is unlikely, as it requires that a removed header would lead to a privilege escalation, however, the Traefik team has addressed this issue to prevent any potential abuse. If one has a chain of Traefik middlewares, and one of them sets a request header, then sending a request with a certain Connection header will cause it to be removed before the request is sent. In this case, the backend does not see the request header. A patch is available in version 2.4.13. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.",
