		"description": "A vulnerability has been identified in JT2Go (All versions < V13.2), Teamcenter Visualization (All versions < V13.2). The VisDraw.dll library in affected applications lacks proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing J2K files. This could result in an out of bounds read past the end of an allocated buffer.
