		"description": "A vulnerability in the identity-based firewall (IDFW) rule processing feature of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass security protections. This vulnerability is due to improper handling of network requests by affected devices configured to use object group search. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted network request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass access control list (ACL) rules on the device, bypass security protections, and send network traffic to unauthorized hosts.",
