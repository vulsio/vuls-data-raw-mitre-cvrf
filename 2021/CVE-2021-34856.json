  "notes": {
    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Parallels Desktop 16.1.3 (49160). An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target guest system in order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the virtio-gpu virtual device. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a memory corruption condition. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the hypervisor. Was ZDI-CAN-13581.",
