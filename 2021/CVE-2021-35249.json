		"description": "This broken access control vulnerability pertains specifically to a domain admin who can access configuration & user data of other domains which they should not have access to. Please note the admin is unable to modify the data (read only operation). This UAC issue leads to a data leak to unauthorized users for a domain, with no log of them accessing the data unless they attempt to modify it. This read-only activity is logged to the original domain and does not specify which domain was accessed.",
