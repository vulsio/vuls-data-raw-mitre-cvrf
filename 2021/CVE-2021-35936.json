		"description": "If remote logging is not used, the worker (in the case of CeleryExecutor) or the scheduler (in the case of LocalExecutor) runs a Flask logging server and is listening on a specific port and also binds on 0.0.0.0 by default. This logging server had no authentication and allows reading log files of DAG jobs. This issue affects Apache Airflow < 2.1.2.",
