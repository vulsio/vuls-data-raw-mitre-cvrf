		"description": "Docker Desktop before 3.6.0 suffers from incorrect access control. If a low-privileged account is able to access the server running the Windows containers, it can lead to a full container compromise in both process isolation and Hyper-V isolation modes. This security issue leads an attacker with low privilege to read, write and possibly even execute code inside the containers.",
