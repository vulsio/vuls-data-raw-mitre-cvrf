	"notes": {
		"description": "Pomerium is an open source identity-aware access proxy. Envoy, which Pomerium is based on, incorrectly handles resetting of HTTP/2 streams with excessive complexity. This can lead to high CPU utilization when a large number of streams are reset. This can result in a DoS condition. Pomerium versions 0.14.8 and 0.15.1 contain an upgraded envoy binary with this vulnerability patched.",
