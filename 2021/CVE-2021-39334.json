		"description": "The Job Board Vanila WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting due to insufficient input validation and sanitization via the psjb_exp_in and the psjb_curr_in parameters found in the ~/job-settings.php file which allowed attackers with administrative user access to inject arbitrary web scripts, in versions up to and including 1.0. This affects multi-site installations where unfiltered_html is disabled for administrators, and sites where unfiltered_html is disabled.",
