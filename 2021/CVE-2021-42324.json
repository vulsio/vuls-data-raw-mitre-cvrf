			"text": "An issue was discovered on DCN (Digital China Networks) S4600-10P-SI devices before R0241.0470. Due to improper parameter validation in the console interface, it is possible for a low-privileged authenticated attacker to escape the sandbox environment and execute system commands as root via shell metacharacters in the capture command parameters. Command output will be shown on the Serial interface of the device. Exploitation requires both credentials and physical access."
