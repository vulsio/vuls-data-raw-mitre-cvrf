		"description": "An issue was discovered in CALDERA 2.8.1. When activated, the Human plugin passes the unsanitized name parameter to a python \"os.system\" function. This allows attackers to use shell metacharacters (e.g., backticks \"``\" or dollar parenthesis \"$()\" ) in order to escape the current command and execute arbitrary shell commands.",
