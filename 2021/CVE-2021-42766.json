			"text": "The Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Ethereum consensus protocol through 2021-10-19 allows an adversary to cause a denial of service (long-range consensus chain reorganizations), even when this adversary has little stake and cannot influence network message propagation. This can cause a protocol stall, or an increase in the profits of individual validators."
