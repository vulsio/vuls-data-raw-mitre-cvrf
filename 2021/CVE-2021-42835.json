  "notes": {
    "description": "An issue was discovered in Plex Media Server through 1.24.4.5081-e362dc1ee. An attacker (with a foothold in a endpoint via a low-privileged user account) can access the exposed RPC service of the update service component. This RPC functionality allows the attacker to interact with the RPC functionality and execute code from a path of his choice (local, or remote via SMB) because of a TOCTOU race condition. This code execution is in the context of the Plex update service (which runs as SYSTEM).",
