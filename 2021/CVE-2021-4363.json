		{
			"type": "Description",
			"text": "The WP Quick FrontEnd Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 5.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on the 'save_content_front' function that uses print_r on the user-supplied $_REQUEST values . This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
