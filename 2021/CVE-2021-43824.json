		"description": "Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy, designed for cloud-native applications. In affected versions a crafted request crashes Envoy when a CONNECT request is sent to JWT filter configured with regex match. This provides a denial of service attack vector. The only workaround is to not use regex in the JWT filter. Users are advised to upgrade.",
