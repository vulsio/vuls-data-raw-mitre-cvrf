  "notes": {
    "description": "The Contact Form 7 Style plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the manage_wp_posts_be_qe_save_post() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to quick edit templates via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
