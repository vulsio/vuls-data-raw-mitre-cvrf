  "notes": {
    "description": "The Amministrazione Trasparente plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 7.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the at_save_aturl_meta() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update meta data via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
