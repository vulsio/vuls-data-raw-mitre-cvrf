    "description": "The WP-Backgrounds Lite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the ino_save_data() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to save meta data via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
