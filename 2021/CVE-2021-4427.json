			"text": "The Vuukle Comments, Reactions, Share Bar, Revenue plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.4.31. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation in the /admin/partials/free-comments-for-wordpress-vuukle-admin-display.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to edit the plugins settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
