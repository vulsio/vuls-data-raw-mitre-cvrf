    "description": "In CWP (aka Control Web Panel or CentOS Web Panel) before 0.9.8.1107, an unauthenticated attacker can use %00 bytes to cause /user/loader.php to register an arbitrary API key, as demonstrated by a /user/loader.php?api=1&scripts= .%00./.%00./api/account_new_create&acc=guadaapi URI. Any number of %00 instances can be used, e.g., .%00%00%00./.%00%00%00./api/account_new_create could also be used for the scripts parameter.",
