		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: dmaengine: idxd: Fix clobbering of SWERR overflow bit on writeback Current code blindly writes over the SWERR and the OVERFLOW bits. Write back the bits actually read instead so the driver avoids clobbering the OVERFLOW bit that comes after the register is read.",
