		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ALSA: hda: intel-sdw-acpi: harden detection of controller The existing code currently sets a pointer to an ACPI handle before checking that it's actually a SoundWire controller. This can lead to issues where the graph walk continues and eventually fails, but the pointer was set already. This patch changes the logic so that the information provided to the caller is set when a controller is found.",
