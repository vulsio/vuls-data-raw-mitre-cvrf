		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ext4: always panic when errors=panic is specified Before commit 014c9caa29d3 (\"ext4: make ext4_abort() use __ext4_error()\"), the following series of commands would trigger a panic: 1. mount /dev/sda -o ro,errors=panic test 2. mount /dev/sda -o remount,abort test After commit 014c9caa29d3, remounting a file system using the test mount option \"abort\" will no longer trigger a panic. This commit will restore the behaviour immediately before commit 014c9caa29d3. (However, note that the Linux kernel's behavior has not been consistent; some previous kernel versions, including 5.4 and 4.19 similarly did not panic after using the mount option \"abort\".) This also makes a change to long-standing behaviour; namely, the following series commands will now cause a panic, when previously it did not: 1. mount /dev/sda -o ro,errors=panic test 2. echo test > /sys/fs/ext4/sda/trigger_fs_error However, this makes ext4's behaviour much more consistent, so this is a good thing.",
