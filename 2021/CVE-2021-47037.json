		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ASoC: q6afe-clocks: fix reprobing of the driver Q6afe-clocks driver can get reprobed. For example if the APR services are restarted after the firmware crash. However currently Q6afe-clocks driver will oops because hw.init will get cleared during first _probe call. Rewrite the driver to fill the clock data at runtime rather than using big static array of clocks.",
