		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: x86/kvm: Disable kvmclock on all CPUs on shutdown Currenly, we disable kvmclock from machine_shutdown() hook and this only happens for boot CPU. We need to disable it for all CPUs to guard against memory corruption e.g. on restore from hibernate. Note, writing '0' to kvmclock MSR doesn't clear memory location, it just prevents hypervisor from updating the location so for the short while after write and while CPU is still alive, the clock remains usable and correct so we don't need to switch to some other clocksource.",
