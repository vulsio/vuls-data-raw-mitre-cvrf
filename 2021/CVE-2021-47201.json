			"type": "Description",
			"text": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: iavf: free q_vectors before queues in iavf_disable_vf iavf_free_queues() clears adapter->num_active_queues, which iavf_free_q_vectors() relies on, so swap the order of these two function calls in iavf_disable_vf(). This resolves a panic encountered when the interface is disabled and then later brought up again after PF communication is restored."
