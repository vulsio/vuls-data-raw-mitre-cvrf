			"text": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: can: j1939: fix Use-after-Free, hold skb ref while in use This patch fixes a Use-after-Free found by the syzbot. The problem is that a skb is taken from the per-session skb queue, without incrementing the ref count. This leads to a Use-after-Free if the skb is taken concurrently from the session queue due to a CTS."
