			"type": "Description",
			"text": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ipv6: fix another slab-out-of-bounds in fib6_nh_flush_exceptions While running the self-tests on a KASAN enabled kernel, I observed a slab-out-of-bounds splat very similar to the one reported in commit 821bbf79fe46 (\"ipv6: Fix KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds Read in fib6_nh_flush_exceptions\"). We additionally need to take care of fib6_metrics initialization failure when the caller provides an nh. The fix is similar, explicitly free the route instead of calling fib6_info_release on a half-initialized object."
