		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ext4: fix possible UAF when remounting r/o a mmp-protected file system After commit 618f003199c6 (\"ext4: fix memory leak in ext4_fill_super\"), after the file system is remounted read-only, there is a race where the kmmpd thread can exit, causing sbi->s_mmp_tsk to point at freed memory, which the call to ext4_stop_mmpd() can trip over. Fix this by only allowing kmmpd() to exit when it is stopped via ext4_stop_mmpd(). Bug-Report-Link: <20210629143603.2166962-1-yebin10@huawei.com>",
