		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: dma-debug: prevent an error message from causing runtime problems For some drivers, that use the DMA API. This error message can be reached several millions of times per second, causing spam to the kernel's printk buffer and bringing the CPU usage up to 100% (so, it should be rate limited). However, since there is at least one driver that is in the mainline and suffers from the error condition, it is more useful to err_printk() here instead of just rate limiting the error message (in hopes that it will make it easier for other drivers that suffer from this issue to be spotted).",
