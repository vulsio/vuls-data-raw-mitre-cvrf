		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: mm, slub: fix potential use-after-free in slab_debugfs_fops When sysfs_slab_add failed, we shouldn't call debugfs_slab_add() for s because s will be freed soon. And slab_debugfs_fops will use s later leading to a use-after-free.",
