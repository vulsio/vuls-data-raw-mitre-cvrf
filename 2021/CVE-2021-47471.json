		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: drm: mxsfb: Fix NULL pointer dereference crash on unload The mxsfb->crtc.funcs may already be NULL when unloading the driver, in which case calling mxsfb_irq_disable() via drm_irq_uninstall() from mxsfb_unload() leads to NULL pointer dereference. Since all we care about is masking the IRQ and mxsfb->base is still valid, just use that to clear and mask the IRQ.",
