		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: comedi: vmk80xx: fix transfer-buffer overflows The driver uses endpoint-sized USB transfer buffers but up until recently had no sanity checks on the sizes. Commit e1f13c879a7c (\"staging: comedi: check validity of wMaxPacketSize of usb endpoints found\") inadvertently fixed NULL-pointer dereferences when accessing the transfer buffers in case a malicious device has a zero wMaxPacketSize. Make sure to allocate buffers large enough to handle also the other accesses that are done without a size check (e.g. byte 18 in vmk80xx_cnt_insn_read() for the VMK8061_MODEL) to avoid writing beyond the buffers, for example, when doing descriptor fuzzing. The original driver was for a low-speed device with 8-byte buffers. Support was later added for a device that uses bulk transfers and is presumably a full-speed device with a maximum 64-byte wMaxPacketSize.",
