			"type": "Description",
			"text": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: mlxsw: spectrum: Protect driver from buggy firmware When processing port up/down events generated by the device's firmware, the driver protects itself from events reported for non-existent local ports, but not the CPU port (local port 0), which exists, but lacks a netdev. This can result in a NULL pointer dereference when calling netif_carrier_{on,off}(). Fix this by bailing early when processing an event reported for the CPU port. Problem was only observed when running on top of a buggy emulator."
