		"description": "A lack of password change protection vulnerability in a depreciated API of McAfee Enterprise ePolicy Orchestrator (ePO) prior to 5.10 Update 13 allows a remote attacker to change the password of a compromised session without knowing the existing user's password. This functionality was removed from the User Interface in ePO 10 and the API has now been disabled. Other protection is in place to reduce the likelihood of this being successful through sending a link to a logged in user.",
