    "description": "A vulnerability in the packet processing functionality of Cisco TelePresence Collaboration Endpoint (CE) Software and Cisco RoomOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted H.323 traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to either reboot normally or reboot into maintenance mode, which could result in a DoS condition on the device.",
