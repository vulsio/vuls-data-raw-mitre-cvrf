		"description": "The code in UEK6 U3 was missing an appropiate file descriptor count to be missing. This resulted in a use count error that allowed a file descriptor to a socket to be closed and freed while it was still in use by another portion of the kernel. An attack with local access can operate on the socket, and cause a denial of service. CVSS 3.1 Base Score 5.5 (Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).",
