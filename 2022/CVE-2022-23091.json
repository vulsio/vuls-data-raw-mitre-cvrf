		"description": "A particular case of memory sharing is mishandled in the virtual memory system. This is very similar to SA-21:08.vm, but with a different root cause. An unprivileged local user process can maintain a mapping of a page after it is freed, allowing that process to read private data belonging to other processes or the kernel.",
