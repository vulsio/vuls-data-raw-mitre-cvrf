    "description": "YzmCMS v6.3 is affected by broken access control. Without login, unauthorized access to the user's personal home page can be realized. It is necessary to judge the user's login status before accessing the personal home page, but the vulnerability can access other users' home pages through the non login status because real authentication is not carried out.",
