			"type": "Description",
			"text": "MeterSphere is a one-stop open source continuous testing platform. Versions prior to 2.4.1 are vulnerable to Path Injection in ApiTestCaseService::deleteBodyFiles which takes a user-controlled string id and passes it to ApiTestCaseService, which uses the user-provided value (testId) in new File(BODY_FILE_DIR + \"/\" + testId), being deleted later by file.delete(). By adding some camouflage parameters to the url, an attacker can target files on the server. The vulnerability has been fixed in v2.4.1."
