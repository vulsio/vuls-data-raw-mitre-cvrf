			"text": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Sonos One Speaker prior to 3.4.1 (S2 systems) and 11.2.13 build 57923290 (S1 systems). Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the anacapd daemon.
