SMTP Command Injection in Appointment Emails via Newlines: as newlines and special characters are not sanitized in the email value in the JSON request, a malicious attacker can inject newlines to break out of the `RCPT TO:<BOOKING USER'S EMAIL> ` SMTP command and begin injecting arbitrary SMTP commands. It is recommended that Calendar is upgraded to 3.2.2. There are no workaround available."
