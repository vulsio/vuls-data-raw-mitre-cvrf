    "description": "Spectre BHB is a variant of Spectre-v2 in which malicious code uses the shared branch history (stored in the CPU BHB) to influence mispredicted branches in the victim's hardware context. Speculation caused by these mispredicted branches can then potentially be used to cause cache allocation, which can then be used to infer information that should be protected.",
