			"text": "There exists an arbitrary memory read within the Linux Kernel BPF - Constants provided to fill pointers in structs passed in to bpf_sys_bpf are not verified and can point anywhere, including memory not owned by BPF. An attacker with CAP_BPF can arbitrarily read memory from anywhere on the system. We recommend upgrading past commit 86f44fcec22c"
