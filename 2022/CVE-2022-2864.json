		"description": "The demon image annotation plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 4.7. This is due to missing nonce validation in the ~/includes/settings.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin's settings and inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
