			"text": "There's a possible overflow in handle_image() when shim tries to load and execute crafted EFI executables; The handle_image() function takes into account the SizeOfRawData field from each section to be loaded. An attacker can leverage this to perform out-of-bound writes into memory. Arbitrary code execution is not discarded in such scenario."
