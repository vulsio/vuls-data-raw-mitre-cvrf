    "description": "Avanquest Software RAD PDF (PDFEscape Online) 3.19.2.2 is vulnerable to Information Leak / Disclosure. The PDFEscape Online tool provides users with a \"white out\" functionality for redacting images, text, and other graphics from a PDF document. However, this mechanism does not remove underlying text or PDF object specification information from the PDF. As a result, for example, redacted text may be copy-pasted by a PDF reader.",
