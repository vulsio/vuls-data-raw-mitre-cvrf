	"notes": {
		"description": "Discourse Calendar is a calendar plugin for Discourse, an open-source messaging app. Prior to version 1.0.1, parsing and rendering of Event names can be susceptible to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. This vulnerability only affects sites which have modified or disabled Discourseâ€™s default Content Security Policy. This issue is patched in version 1.0.1 of the Discourse Calendar plugin. As a workaround, ensure that the Content Security Policy is enabled, and has not been modified in a way which would make it more vulnerable to XSS attacks.",
