Users can create branches via the REST endpoint `POST git/:id/branches` regardless of the permissions set on the repository. This issue has been fixed in version 13.10.99.82 Tuleap Community Edition as well as in version 13.10-3 of Tuleap Enterprise Edition. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue."
