			"text": "curl < 7.84.0 supports \"chained\" HTTP compression algorithms, meaning that a serverresponse can be compressed multiple times and potentially with different algorithms. The number of acceptable \"links\" in this \"decompression chain\" was unbounded, allowing a malicious server to insert a virtually unlimited number of compression steps.The use of such a decompression chain could result in a \"malloc bomb\", makingcurl end up spending enormous amounts of allocated heap memory, or trying toand returning out of memory errors."
