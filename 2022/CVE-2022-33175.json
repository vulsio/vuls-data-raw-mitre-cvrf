  "notes": {
    "description": "Power Distribution Units running on Powertek firmware (multiple brands) before 3.30.30 have an insecure permissions setting on the user.token field that is accessible to everyone through the /cgi/get_param.cgi HTTP API. This leads to disclosing active session ids of currently logged-in administrators. The session id can then be reused to act as the administrator, allowing reading of the cleartext password, or reconfiguring the device.",
