			"text": "The Gutenberg plugin through 13.7.3 for WordPress allows stored XSS by the Contributor role via an SVG document to the \"Insert from URL\" feature. NOTE: the XSS payload does not execute in the context of the WordPress instance's domain; however, analogous attempts by low-privileged users to reference SVG documents are blocked by some similar products, and this behavioral difference might have security relevance to some WordPress site administrators."
