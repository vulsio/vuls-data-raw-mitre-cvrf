		"description": "The Corner Ad plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.56. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on its corner_ad_settings_page function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to trigger the deletion of ads via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
