		"description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Ivanti Avalanche 6.3.3.101. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed. The specific flaw exists within the DeviceLogResource class. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path prior to using it in file operations.
