    "description": "discourse-chat is a plugin for the Discourse message board which adds chat functionality. In versions prior to 0.9 some places render a chat channel's name and description in an unsafe way, allowing staff members to cause an cross site scripting (XSS) attack by inserting unsafe HTML into them.
