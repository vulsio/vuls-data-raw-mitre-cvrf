		{
			"type": "Description",
			"text": "The Simple:Press plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'postitem' parameter manipulated during the profile-save action when modifying a profile signature in versions up to, and including, 6.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping that makes injecting object and embed tags possible. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with minimal permissions, such as a subscriber to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages when modifying a profile signature that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page."
