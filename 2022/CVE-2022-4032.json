    "description": "The Quiz and Survey Master plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to iFrame Injection via the 'question[id]' parameter in versions up to, and including, 8.0.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping that allowed iframe tags to be injected. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject iFrames in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
