    "description": "A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was found in the 'oob' OAuth endpoint due to incorrect null-byte handling. This issue allows a malicious link to insert an arbitrary URI into a Keycloak error page. This flaw requires a user or administrator to interact with a link in order to be vulnerable.
