	"notes": {
		"description": "The physical IoT device of the AliveCor's KardiaMobile, a smartphone-based personal electrocardiogram (EKG) has no encryption for its data-over-sound protocols. Exploiting this vulnerability could allow an attacker to read patient EKG results or create a denial-of-service condition by emitting sounds at similar frequencies as the device, disrupting the smartphone microphoneâ€™s ability to accurately read the data. To carry out this attack, the attacker must be close (less than 5 feet) to pick up and emit sound waves.",
