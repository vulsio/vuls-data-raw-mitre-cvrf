    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Corel CorelDRAW Graphics Suite 23.5.0.506. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of CGM files. When parsing CGM files, the process does not properly validate the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-16356.",
