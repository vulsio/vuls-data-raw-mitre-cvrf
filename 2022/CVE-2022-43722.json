		"description": "A vulnerability has been identified in SICAM PAS/PQS (All versions < V7.0). Affected software does not properly secure a folder containing library files. This could allow an attacker to place a custom malicious DLL in this folder which is then run with SYSTEM rights when a service is started that requires this DLL. At the time of assigning the CVE, the affected firmware version of the component has already been superseded by succeeding mainline versions.",
