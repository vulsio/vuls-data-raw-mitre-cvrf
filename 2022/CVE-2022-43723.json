			"type": "Description",
			"text": "A vulnerability has been identified in SICAM PAS/PQS (All versions < V7.0), SICAM PAS/PQS (All versions >= 7.0 < V8.06). Affected software does not properly validate the input for a certain parameter in the s7ontcp.dll. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to send messages and create a denial of service condition as the application crashes. At the time of assigning the CVE, the affected firmware version of the component has already been superseded by succeeding mainline versions."
