    "description": "A denial of service vulnerability present in ActiveRecord's PostgreSQL adapter <7.0.4.1 and <6.1.7.1. When a value outside the range for a 64bit signed integer is provided to the PostgreSQL connection adapter, it will treat the target column type as numeric. Comparing integer values against numeric values can result in a slow sequential scan resulting in potential Denial of Service.",
