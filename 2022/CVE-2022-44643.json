		"description": "A vulnerability in the label-based access control of Grafana Labs Grafana Enterprise Metrics allows an attacker more access than intended. If an access policy which has label selector restrictions also has been granted access to all tenants in the system, the label selector restrictions will not be applied when using this policy with the affected versions of the software. This issue affects: Grafana Labs Grafana Enterprise Metrics GEM 1.X versions prior to 1.7.1 on AMD64; GEM 2.X versions prior to 2.3.1 on AMD64.",
