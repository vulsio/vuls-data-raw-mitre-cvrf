  "notes": {
    "description": "The Royal Elementor Addons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.3.59. This is due to missing nonce validation in the 'wpr_create_mega_menu_template' AJAX function. This allows unauthenticated attackers to create Mega Menu templates, granted they can trick an administrator into performing an action, such as clicking a link.",
