		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net: macsec: Fix offload support for NETDEV_UNREGISTER event Current macsec netdev notify handler handles NETDEV_UNREGISTER event by releasing relevant SW resources only, this causes resources leak in case of macsec HW offload, as the underlay driver was not notified to clean it's macsec offload resources. Fix by calling the underlay driver to clean it's relevant resources by moving offload handling from macsec_dellink() to macsec_common_dellink() when handling NETDEV_UNREGISTER event.",
