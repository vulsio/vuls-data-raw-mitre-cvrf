According to the doc of kobject_init_and_add() If this function returns an error, kobject_put() must be called to properly clean up the memory associated with the object. Fix this issue by adding kobject_put(). Callback function blk_ia_ranges_sysfs_release() in kobject_put() can handle the pointer \"iars\" properly."
