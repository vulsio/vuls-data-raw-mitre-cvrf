		"description": "The Total Upkeep plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to information disclosure in versions up to, and including 1.14.13. This is due to missing authorization on the heartbeat_received() function that triggers on WordPress heartbeat. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above to retrieve back-up paths that can subsequently be used to download the back-up.",
