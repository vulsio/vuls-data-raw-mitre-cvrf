  "notes": {
    "description": "The Cost Calculator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the nd_cc_meta_box_cc_price_icon parameter in versions up to, and including, 1.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
