			"type": "Description",
			"text": "This vulnerability exists in GajShield Data Security Firewall firmware versions prior to v4.28 (except v4.21) due to insecure default credentials which allows remote attacker to login as superuser by using default username/password via web-based management interface and/or exposed SSH port thereby enabling remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands with administrative/superuser privileges on the targeted systems. The vulnerability has been addressed by forcing the user to change their default password to a new non-default password."
