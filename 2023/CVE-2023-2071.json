	"notes": {
		"description": "Rockwell Automation FactoryTalk View Machine Edition on the PanelView Plus, improperly verifies userâ€™s input, which allows unauthenticated attacker to achieve remote code executed via crafted malicious packets. The device has the functionality, through a CIP class, to execute exported functions from libraries. There is a routine that restricts it to execute specific functions from two dynamic link library files. By using a CIP class, an attacker can upload a self-made library to the device which allows the attacker to bypass the security check and execute any code written in the function.",
