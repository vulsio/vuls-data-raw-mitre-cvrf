		"description": "The BadgeOS plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in versions up to, and including, 3.7.1.6. This is due to improper validation and authorization checks within the badgeos_delete_step_ajax_handler, badgeos_delete_award_step_ajax_handler, badgeos_delete_deduct_step_ajax_handler, and badgeos_delete_rank_req_step_ajax_handler functions. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to delete arbitrary posts.",
