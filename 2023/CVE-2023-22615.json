    "description": "An issue was discovered in IhisiSmm in Insyde InsydeH2O with kernel 5.0 through 5.5. IHISI subfunction execution may corrupt SMRAM. An attacker can pass an address in the RCX save state register that overlaps SMRAM, thereby coercing an IHISI subfunction handler to overwrite private SMRAM.",
