    "description": "Silverstripe Framework is the Model-View-Controller framework that powers the Silverstripe content management system. Prior to version 4.12.15, the GridField print view incorrectly validates the permission of DataObjects potentially allowing a content author to view records they are not authorised to access. Users should upgrade to Silverstripe Framework 4.12.15 or above to address the issue.",
