		"description": "Rapid7 Insight Agent token handler versions 3.2.6 and below, suffer from a Directory Traversal vulnerability whereby unsanitized input from a CLI argument flows into io.ioutil.WriteFile, where it is used as a path. This can result in a Path Traversal vulnerability and allow an attacker to write arbitrary files. This issue is remediated in version 3.3.0 via safe guards that reject inputs that attempt to do path traversal.",
