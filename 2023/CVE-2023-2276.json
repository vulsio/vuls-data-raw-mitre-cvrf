  "notes": {
    "description": "The WCFM Membership â€“ WooCommerce Memberships for Multivendor Marketplace plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object References in versions up to, and including, 2.10.7. This is due to the plugin providing user-controlled access to objects, letting a user bypass authorization and access system resources. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change user passwords and potentially take over administrator accounts.",
