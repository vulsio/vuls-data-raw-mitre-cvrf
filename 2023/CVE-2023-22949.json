    "description": "An issue was discovered in TigerGraph Enterprise Free Edition 3.x. There is logging of user credentials. All authenticated GSQL access requests are logged by TigerGraph in multiple places. Each request includes both the username and password of the user in an easily decodable base64 form. That could allow a TigerGraph administrator to effectively harvest usernames/passwords.",
