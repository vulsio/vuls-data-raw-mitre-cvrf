  "notes": {
    "description": "** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** dtprintinfo in Common Desktop Environment 1.6 has a bug in the parser of lpstat (an invoked external command) during listing of the names of available printers. This allows low-privileged local users to inject arbitrary printer names via the $HOME/.printers file. This injection allows those users to manipulate the control flow and disclose memory contents on Solaris 10 systems. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.",
