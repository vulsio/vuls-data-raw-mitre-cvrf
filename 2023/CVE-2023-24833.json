    "description": "A use-after-free in BigIntPrimitive addition in Hermes prior to commit a6dcafe6ded8e61658b40f5699878cd19a481f80 could have been used by an attacker to leak raw data from Hermes VMâ€™s heap. Note that this is only exploitable in cases where Hermes is used to execute untrusted JavaScript. Hence, most React Native applications are not affected.",
