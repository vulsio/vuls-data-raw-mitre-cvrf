			"text": "The `PaperCutNG Mobility Print` version 1.0.3512 application allows an unauthenticated attacker to perform a CSRF attack on an instance administrator to configure the clients host (in the \"configure printer discovery\" section). This is possible because the application has no protections against CSRF attacks, like Anti-CSRF tokens, header origin validation, samesite cookies, etc."
