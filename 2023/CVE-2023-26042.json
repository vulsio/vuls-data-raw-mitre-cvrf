User input was found not being properly escaped, which allowed malicious users to inject arbitrary HTML into the pages. The Content-Security-Policy forbids inline and external scripts so it is not possible to execute JavaScript code, unless in combination with other vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds, please upgrade to Pat-DB 1.0.2 or later."
