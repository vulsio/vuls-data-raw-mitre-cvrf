		"description": "Versions of the package raysan5/raylib before 4.5.0 are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) such that the SetClipboardText API does not properly escape the ' character, allowing attacker-controlled input to break out of the string and execute arbitrary JavaScript via emscripten_run_script function. **Note:** This vulnerability is present only when compiling raylib for PLATFORM_WEB. All the other Desktop/Mobile/Embedded platforms are not affected.",
