    "description": "Rockwell Automation's FactoryTalk System Services does not verify that a backup configuration archive is password protected. Improper authorization in FTSSBackupRestore.exe may lead to the loading of malicious configuration archives. This vulnerability may allow a local, authenticated non-admin user to craft a malicious backup archive, without password protection, that will be loaded by FactoryTalk System Services as a valid backup when a restore procedure takes places. User interaction is required for this vulnerability to be successfully exploited.",
