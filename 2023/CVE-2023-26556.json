			"type": "Description",
			"text": "io.finnet tss-lib before 2.0.0 can leak a secret key via a timing side-channel attack because it relies on the scalar-multiplication implementation in Go crypto/elliptic, which is not constant time (there is an if statement in a loop). One leak is in ecdsa/keygen/round_2.go. (bnb-chain/tss-lib and thorchain/tss are also affected.)"
