		"description": "Sangoma FreePBX 1805 through 2302 (when obtained as a ,.ISO file) places AMPDBUSER, AMPDBPASS, AMPMGRUSER, and AMPMGRPASS in the list of global variables. This exposes cleartext authentication credentials for the Asterisk Database (MariaDB/MySQL) and Asterisk Manager Interface. For example, an attacker can make a /ari/asterisk/variable?variable=AMPDBPASS API call.",
