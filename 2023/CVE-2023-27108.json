    "description": "An issue was discovered in KaiOS 3.0. The pre-installed Communications application exposes a Web Activity that returns the user's call log without origin or permission checks. An attacker can inject a JavaScript payload that runs in a browser or app without user interaction or consent. This allows an attacker to send the user's call logs to a remote server via XMLHttpRequest or Fetch.",
