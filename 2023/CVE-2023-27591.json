		"description": "Miniflux is a feed reader. Prior to version 2.0.43, an unauthenticated user can retrieve Prometheus metrics from a publicly reachable Miniflux instance where the `METRICS_COLLECTOR` configuration option is enabled and `METRICS_ALLOWED_NETWORKS` is set to `127.0.0.1/8` (the default). A patch is available in Miniflux 2.0.43. As a workaround, set `METRICS_COLLECTOR` to `false` (default) or run Miniflux behind a trusted reverse-proxy.",
