    "description": "A bytecode optimization bug in Hermes prior to commit e6ed9c1a4b02dc219de1648f44cd808a56171b81 could be used to cause an use-after-free and obtain arbitrary code execution via a carefully crafted payload. Note that this is only exploitable in cases where Hermes is used to execute untrusted JavaScript. Hence, most React Native applications are not affected.",
