	"notes": {
		"description": "The crewjam/saml go library contains a partial implementation of the SAML standard in golang. Prior to version 0.4.13, the package's use of `flate.NewReader` does not limit the size of the input. The user can pass more than 1 MB of data in the HTTP request to the processing functions, which will be decompressed server-side using the Deflate algorithm. Therefore, after repeating the same request multiple times, it is possible to achieve a reliable crash since the operating system kills the process. This issue is patched in version 0.4.13.",
