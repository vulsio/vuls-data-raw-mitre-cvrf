    "description": "An NTFS Junction condition exists in the Qualys Cloud Agent for Windows platform in versions before 4.8.0.31. Attackers may write files to arbitrary locations via a local attack vector. This allows attackers to assume the privileges of the process, and they may delete or otherwise on unauthorized files, allowing for the potential modification or deletion of sensitive files limited only to that specific directory/file object. This vulnerability is bounded to the time of installation/uninstallation and can only be exploited locally. At the time of this disclosure, versions before 4.0 are classified as End of Life.",
