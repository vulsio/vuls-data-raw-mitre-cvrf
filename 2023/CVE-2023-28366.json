		"description": "The broker in Eclipse Mosquitto 1.3.2 through 2.x before 2.0.16 has a memory leak that can be abused remotely when a client sends many QoS 2 messages with duplicate message IDs, and fails to respond to PUBREC commands. This occurs because of mishandling of EAGAIN from the libc send function.",
