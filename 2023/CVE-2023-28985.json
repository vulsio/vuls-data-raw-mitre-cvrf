			"text": "An Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input vulnerability in Intrusion Detection and Prevention (IDP) of Juniper Networks SRX Series and MX Series allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause Denial of Service (DoS). Continued receipt of this specific packet will cause a sustained Denial of Service condition. On all SRX Series and MX Series platforms, where IDP is enabled and a specific malformed SSL packet is received, the SSL detector crashes leading to an FPC core. This issue affects Juniper Networks SRX Series and MX Series prior to SigPack 3598. In order to identify the current SigPack version, following command can be used: user@junos# show security idp security-package-version"
