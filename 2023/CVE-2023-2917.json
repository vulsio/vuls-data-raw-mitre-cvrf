		"description": "The Rockwell Automation Thinmanager Thinserver is impacted by an improper input validation vulnerability. Due to an improper input validation, a path traversal vulnerability exists, via the filename field, when the ThinManager processes a certain function. If exploited, an unauthenticated remote attacker can upload arbitrary files to any directory on the disk drive where ThinServer.exe is installed. A malicious user could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted synchronization protocol message and potentially gain remote code execution abilities.",
