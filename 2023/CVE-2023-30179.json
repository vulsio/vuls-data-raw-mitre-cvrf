    "description": "** DISPUTED ** CraftCMS version 3.7.59 is vulnerable to Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI). An authenticated attacker can inject Twig Template to User Photo Location field when setting User Photo Location in User Settings, lead to Remote Code Execution. NOTE: the vendor disputes this because only Administrators can add this Twig code, and (by design) Administrators are allowed to do that by default.",
