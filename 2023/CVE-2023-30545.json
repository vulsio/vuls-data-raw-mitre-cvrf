			"text": "PrestaShop is an Open Source e-commerce web application. Prior to versions 8.0.4 and 1.7.8.9, it is possible for a user with access to the SQL Manager (Advanced Options -> Database) to arbitrarily read any file on the operating system when using SQL function `LOAD_FILE` in a `SELECT` request. This gives the user access to critical information. A patch is available in PrestaShop 8.0.4 and PS 1.7.8.9"
