			"text": "matrix-react-sdk is a react-based SDK for inserting a Matrix chat/VoIP client into a web page. Prior to version 3.71.0, plain text messages containing HTML tags are rendered as HTML in the search results. To exploit this, an attacker needs to trick a user into searching for a specific message containing an HTML injection payload. No cross-site scripting attack is possible due to the hardcoded content security policy. Version 3.71.0 of the SDK patches over the issue. As a workaround, restarting the client will clear the HTML injection."
