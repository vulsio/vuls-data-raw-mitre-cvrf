		"description": "Jellyfin is a free-software media system. Versions starting with 10.8.0 and prior to 10.8.10 and prior have a directory traversal vulnerability inside the `ClientLogController`, specifically `/ClientLog/Document`. When combined with a cross-site scripting vulnerability (CVE-2023-30627), this can result in file write and arbitrary code execution. Version 10.8.10 has a patch for this issue. There are no known workarounds.",
