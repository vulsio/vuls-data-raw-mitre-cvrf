			"type": "Description",
			"text": "A flaw was found in the QEMU built-in VNC server while processing ClientCutText messages. A wrong exit condition may lead to an infinite loop when inflating an attacker controlled zlib buffer in the `inflate_buffer` function. This could allow a remote authenticated client who is able to send a clipboard to the VNC server to trigger a denial of service."
