			"type": "Description",
			"text": "Emby Server is a user-installable home media server which stores and organizes a user's media files of virtually any format and makes them available for viewing at home and abroad on a broad range of client devices. This vulnerability may allow administrative access to an Emby Server system, depending on certain user account settings. By spoofing certain headers which are intended for interoperation with reverse proxy servers, it may be possible to affect the local/non-local network determination to allow logging in without password or to view a list of user accounts which may have no password configured. Impacted are all Emby Server system which are publicly accessible and where the administrator hasn't tightened the account login configuration for administrative users. This issue has been patched in Emby Server Beta version 4.8.31 and Emby Server version 4.7.12."
