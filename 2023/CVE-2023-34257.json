		"description": "** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in BMC Patrol through 23.1.00. The agent's configuration can be remotely modified (and, by default, authentication is not required). Some configuration fields related to SNMP (e.g., masterAgentName or masterAgentStartLine) result in code execution when the agent is restarted. NOTE: the vendor's perspective is \"These are not vulnerabilities for us as we have provided the option to implement the authentication.\"",
