		{
			"type": "Description",
			"text": "When a transaction is committed, C Xenstored will first check the quota is correct before attempting to commit any nodes. It would be possible that accounting is temporarily negative if a node has been removed outside of the transaction. Unfortunately, some versions of C Xenstored are assuming that the quota cannot be negative and are using assert() to confirm it. This will lead to C Xenstored crash when tools are built without -DNDEBUG (this is the default)."
