			"text": "ShowMojo MojoBox Digital Lockbox 1.4 is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass. The implementation of the lock opening mechanism via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is vulnerable to replay attacks. A malicious user is able to intercept BLE requests and replicate them to open the lock at any time. Alternatively, an attacker with physical access to the device on which the Android app is installed, can obtain the latest BLE messages via the app logs and use them for opening the lock."
