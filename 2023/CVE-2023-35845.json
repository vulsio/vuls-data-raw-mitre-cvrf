    "description": "Anaconda 3 2023.03-1-Linux allows local users to disrupt TLS certificate validation by modifying the cacert.pem file used by the installed pip program. This occurs because many files are installed as world-writable on Linux, ignoring umask, even when these files are installed as root. Miniconda is also affected.",
