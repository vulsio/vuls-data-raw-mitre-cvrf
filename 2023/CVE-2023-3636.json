		"description": "The WP Project Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in versions up to, and including, 2.6.4 due to insufficient restriction on the 'save_users_map_name' function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with minimal permissions such as a subscriber, to modify their user role by supplying the 'usernames' parameter.",
