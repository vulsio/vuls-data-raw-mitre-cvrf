    "description": "A Missing Authentication for Critical Function vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause limited impact to the file system integrity. With a specific request to webauth_operation.php that doesn't require authentication, an attacker is able to upload arbitrary files via J-Web, leading to a loss of integrity for a certain part of the file system, which may allow chaining to other vulnerabilities. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series: * 22.4 versions prior to 22,4R2-S2, 22.4R3; * 23.2 versions prior to 23.2R2.",
