		"description": "A flaw was found in the Netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel. The xt_u32 module did not validate the fields in the xt_u32 structure. This flaw allows a local privileged attacker to trigger an out-of-bounds read by setting the size fields with a value beyond the array boundaries, leading to a crash or information disclosure.",
