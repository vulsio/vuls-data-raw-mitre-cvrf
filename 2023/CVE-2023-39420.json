		{
			"type": "Description",
			"text": "The RDPCore.dll component as used in the IRM Next Generation booking engine, allows a remote user to connect to customers with an \"admin\" account and a corresponding password computed daily by a routine inside the DLL file. Once reverse-engineered, this routine can help an attacker generate the daily password and connect to application customers. Given that this is an administrative account, anyone logging into a customer deployment has full, unrestricted access to the application."
