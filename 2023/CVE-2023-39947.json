			"text": "eprosima Fast DDS is a C++ implementation of the Data Distribution Service standard of the Object Management Group. Prior to versions 2.11.1, 2.10.2, 2.9.2, and 2.6.6, even after the fix at commit 3492270, malformed `PID_PROPERTY_LIST` parameters cause heap overflow at a different program counter.
