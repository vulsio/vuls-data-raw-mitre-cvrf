			"type": "Description",
			"text": "An NTLM Hash Disclosure was discovered in ArchiMate Archi before 5.1.0. When parsing the XMLNS value of an ArchiMate project file, if the namespace does not match the expected ArchiMate URL, the parser will access the provided resource. If the provided resource is a UNC path pointing to a share server that does not accept a guest account, the host will try to authenticate on the share by using the current user's session. NOTE: this issue occurs because Archi uses an unsafe configuration of the Eclipse Modeling Framework."
