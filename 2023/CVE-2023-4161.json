			"text": "The WooCommerce PDF Invoice Builder for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery due to a missing nonce check on the SaveCustomField function in versions up to, and including, 1.2.90. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create invoice fields provided they can trick an admin into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
