    "description": "Home assistant is an open source home automation. The assessment verified that webhooks available in the webhook component are triggerable via the `*.ui.nabu.casa` URL without authentication, even when the webhook is marked as Only accessible from the local network. This issue is facilitated by the SniTun proxy, which sets the source address to 127.0.0.1 on all requests sent to the public URL and forwarded to the local Home Assistant. This issue has been addressed in version 2023.9.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
