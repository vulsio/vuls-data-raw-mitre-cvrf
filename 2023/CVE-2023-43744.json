		"description": "An OS command injection vulnerability in Zultys MX-SE, MX-SE II, MX-E, MX-Virtual, MX250, and MX30 with firmware versions prior to 17.0.10 patch 17161 and 16.04 patch 16109 allows an administrator to execute arbitrary OS commands via a file name parameter in a patch application function. The Zultys MX Administrator client has a \"Patch Manager\" section that allows administrators to apply patches to the device. The user supplied filename for the patch file is passed to a shell script without validation. Including bash command substitution characters in a patch file name results in execution of the provided command.",
