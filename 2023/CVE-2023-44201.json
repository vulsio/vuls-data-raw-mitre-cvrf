		{
			"type": "Description",
			"text": "An Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource vulnerability in a specific file of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows a local authenticated attacker to read configuration changes without having the permissions. When a user with the respective permissions commits a configuration change, a specific file is created. That file is readable even by users with no permissions to access the configuration. This can lead to privilege escalation as the user can read the password hash when a password change is being committed. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS * All versions prior to 20.4R3-S4; * 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3-S4; * 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3-S2; * 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R2-S2, 21.3R3-S1; * 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R2-S1, 21.4R3. Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved * All versions prior to 20.4R3-S4-EVO; * 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3-S2-EVO; * 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3-S2-EVO; * 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3-S1-EVO; * 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R2-S2-EVO."
