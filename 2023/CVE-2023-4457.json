    "description": "Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. The Google Sheets data source plugin for Grafana, versions 0.9.0 to 1.2.2 are vulnerable to an information disclosure vulnerability. The plugin did not properly sanitize error messages, making it potentially expose the Google Sheet API-key that is configured for the data source. This vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2.2.",
