		"description": "** DISPUTED ** An issue in MiniZinc before 2.8.0 allows a NULL pointer dereference via ti_expr in a crafted .mzn file. NOTE: this is disputed because there is no common libminizinc use case in which an unattended process is supposed to run forever to process a series of atttacker-controlled .mzn files.",
