		"description": "The LadiApp plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery due to a missing nonce check on the save_config() function in versions up to, and including, 4.3. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the 'ladipage_config' option via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
