		"description": "In the module \"CSV Feeds PRO\" (csvfeeds) < 2.6.1 from Bl Modules for PrestaShop, a guest can download personal information without restriction. Due to too permissive access control which does not force administrator to use password on feeds, a guest can access exports from the module which can lead to leaks of personal information from ps_customer / ps_order table such as name / surname / email / phone number / postal address.",
