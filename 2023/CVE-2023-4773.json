		"description": "The WordPress Social Login plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'wordpress_social_login_meta' shortcode in versions up to, and including, 3.0.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
