The information exposed to unauthorized actors may include sensitive data such as database credentials. Users who can't upgrade to the fixed version can also set environment variable `MANAGEMENT_ENDPOINTS_WEB_EXPOSURE_INCLUDE=health,metrics,prometheus` to workaround this, or add the following section in the `application.yaml` file ``` management: endpoints: web: exposure: include: health,metrics,prometheus ``` This issue affects Apache DolphinScheduler: from 3.0.0 before 3.0.2. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 3.0.2, which fixes the issue.",
