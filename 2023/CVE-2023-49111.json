		{
			"type": "Description",
			"text": "For Kiuwan installations with SSO (single sign-on) enabled, an unauthenticated reflected cross-site scripting attack can be performed on the login page \"login.html\". This is possible due to the request parameter \"message\" values being directly included in a JavaScript block in the response. This is especially critical in business environments using AD SSO authentication, e.g. via ADFS, where attackers could potentially steal AD passwords. This issue affects Kiuwan SAST: <master.1808.p685.q13371"
