	"notes": {
		"description": "The WP User Control plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized password resets in versions up to, and including 1.5.3. This is due to the plugin using native password reset functionality, with insufficient validation on the password reset function (in the WP User Control Widget). The function changes the user's password after providing the email. The new password is only sent to the user's email, so the attacker does not have access to the new password.",
