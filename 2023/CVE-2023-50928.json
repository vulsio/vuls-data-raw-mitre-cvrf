		"description": "\"Sandbox Accounts for Events\" provides multiple, temporary AWS accounts to a number of authenticated users simultaneously via a browser-based GUI. Authenticated users could potentially claim and access empty AWS accounts by sending request payloads to the account API containing non-existent event ids and self-defined budget & duration. This issue only affects cleaned AWS accounts, it is not possible to access AWS accounts in use or existing data/infrastructure. This issue has been patched in version 1.1.0.",
