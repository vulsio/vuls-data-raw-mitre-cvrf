		"description": "The TD Bank TD Advanced Dashboard client through 3.0.3 for macOS allows arbitrary code execution because of the lack of electron::fuses::IsRunAsNodeEnabled (i.e., ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE can be used in production). This makes it easier for a compromised process to access banking information.",
