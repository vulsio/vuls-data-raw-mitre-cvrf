  "notes": {
    "description": "The Live updates from Excel plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'ipushpull_page' shortcode in versions up to, and including, 2.3.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
