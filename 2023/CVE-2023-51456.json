		"description": "A Improper Input Validation issue affecting the v2_sdk_service running on a set of DJI drone devices on the port 10000 could allow an attacker to trigger an out-of-bound read/write into the process memory through a crafted payload due to a missing input sanity check in the v2_pack_array_to_msg function implemented in the libv2_sdk.so library imported by the v2_sdk_service binary implementing the service, potentially leading to a memory information leak or an arbitrary code execution. Affected models are Mavic 3 Pro until v01.01.0300, Mavic 3 until v01.00.1200, Mavic 3 Classic until v01.00.0500, Mavic 3 Enterprise until v07.01.10.03, Matrice 300 until v57.00.01.00, Matrice M30 until v07.01.0022 and Mini 3 Pro until v01.00.0620.",
