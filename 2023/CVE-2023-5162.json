	"notes": {
		"description": "The Options for Twenty Seventeen plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via 'social-links' shortcode in versions up to, and including, 2.5.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
