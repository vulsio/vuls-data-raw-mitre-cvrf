		"description": "Exim through 4.97 allows SMTP smuggling in certain configurations. Remote attackers can use a published exploitation technique to inject e-mail messages that appear to originate from the Exim server, allowing bypass of an SPF protection mechanism. This occurs because Exim supports <LF>.<CR><LF> but some other popular e-mail servers do not.",
