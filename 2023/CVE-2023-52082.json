			"type": "Description",
			"text": "Lychee is a free photo-management tool. Prior to 5.0.2, Lychee is vulnerable to an SQL injection on any binding when using mysql/mariadb. This injection is only active for users with the `.env` settings set to DB_LOG_SQL=true and DB_LOG_SQL_EXPLAIN=true. The defaults settings of Lychee are safe. The patch is provided on version 5.0.2. To work around this issue, disable SQL EXPLAIN logging."
