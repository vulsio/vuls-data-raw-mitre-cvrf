		"description": "A flaw was found in libnbd. A server can reply with a block size larger than 2^63 (the NBD spec states the size is a 64-bit unsigned value). This issue could lead to an application crash or other unintended behavior for NBD clients that doesn't treat the return value of the nbd_get_size() function correctly.",
