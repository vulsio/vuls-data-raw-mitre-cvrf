			"type": "Description",
			"text": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ASoC: SOF: amd: Fix memory leak in amd_sof_acp_probe() Driver uses kasprintf() to initialize fw_{code,data}_bin members of struct acp_dev_data, but kfree() is never called to deallocate the memory, which results in a memory leak. Fix the issue by switching to devm_kasprintf(). Additionally, ensure the allocation was successful by checking the pointer validity."
