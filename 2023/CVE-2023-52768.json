		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: wifi: wilc1000: use vmm_table as array in wilc struct Enabling KASAN and running some iperf tests raises some memory issues with vmm_table: BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in wilc_wlan_handle_txq+0x6ac/0xdb4 Write of size 4 at addr c3a61540 by task wlan0-tx/95 KASAN detects that we are writing data beyond range allocated to vmm_table. There is indeed a mismatch between the size passed to allocator in wilc_wlan_init, and the range of possible indexes used later: allocation size is missing a multiplication by sizeof(u32)",
