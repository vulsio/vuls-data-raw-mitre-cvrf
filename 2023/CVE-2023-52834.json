			"type": "Description",
			"text": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: atl1c: Work around the DMA RX overflow issue This is based on alx driver commit 881d0327db37 (\"net: alx: Work around the DMA RX overflow issue\"). The alx and atl1c drivers had RX overflow error which was why a custom allocator was created to avoid certain addresses. The simpler workaround then created for alx driver, but not for atl1c due to lack of tester. Instead of using a custom allocator, check the allocated skb address and use skb_reserve() to move away from problematic 0x...fc0 address. Tested on AR8131 on Acer 4540."
