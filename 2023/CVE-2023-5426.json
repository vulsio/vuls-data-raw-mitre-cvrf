    "description": "The Post Meta Data Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the pmdm_wp_delete_user_meta, pmdm_wp_delete_term_meta, and pmdm_wp_ajax_delete_meta functions in versions up to, and including, 1.2.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete user, term, and post meta belonging to arbitrary users.",
