		"description": "The Business Directory Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to CSV Injection in versions up to, and including, 6.4.3 via the class-csv-exporter.php file. This allows authenticated attackers, with author-level permissions and above, to embed untrusted input into CSV files exported by administrators, which can result in code execution when these files are downloaded and opened on a local system with a vulnerable configuration.",
