		"description": "The Thumbnail Slider With Lightbox plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the delete functionality. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete image lightboxes via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
