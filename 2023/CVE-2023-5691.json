	"notes": {
		"description": "The Chatbot for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in version 2.3.9 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.",
