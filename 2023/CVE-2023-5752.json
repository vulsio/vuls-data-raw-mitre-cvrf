		"description": "When installing a package from a Mercurial VCS URL (ie \"pip install hg+...\") with pip prior to v23.3, the specified Mercurial revision could be used to inject arbitrary configuration options to the \"hg clone\" call (ie \"--config\"). Controlling the Mercurial configuration can modify how and which repository is installed. This vulnerability does not affect users who aren't installing from Mercurial.",
