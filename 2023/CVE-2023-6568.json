	"notes": {
		"description": "A reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the mlflow/mlflow repository, specifically within the handling of the Content-Type header in POST requests. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the Content-Type header, which is then improperly reflected back to the user without adequate sanitization or escaping, leading to arbitrary JavaScript execution in the context of the victim's browser. The vulnerability is present in the mlflow/server/auth/__init__.py file, where the user-supplied Content-Type header is directly injected into a Python formatted string and returned to the user, facilitating the XSS attack.",
