	"notes": {
		"description": "A flaw was found in the QEMU built-in VNC server while processing ClientCutText messages. The qemu_clipboard_request() function can be reached before vnc_server_cut_text_caps() was called and had the chance to initialize the clipboard peer, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. This could allow a malicious authenticated VNC client to crash QEMU and trigger a denial of service.",
