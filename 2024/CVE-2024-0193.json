If the catchall element is garbage-collected when the pipapo set is removed, the element can be deactivated twice. This can cause a use-after-free issue on an NFT_CHAIN object or NFT_OBJECT object, allowing a local unprivileged user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability to escalate their privileges on the system.",
