			"text": "The Form Maker by 10Web â€“ Mobile-Friendly Drag & Drop Contact Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.15.21. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'execute' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary methods in the 'BoosterController' class via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
