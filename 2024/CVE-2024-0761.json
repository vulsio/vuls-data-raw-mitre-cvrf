		"description": "The File Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 7.2.1 due to insufficient randomness in the backup filenames, which use a timestamp plus 4 random digits. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers, to extract sensitive data including site backups in configurations where the .htaccess file in the directory does not block access.",
