		"description": "The Brizy â€“ Page Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's contact form widget error message and redirect URL in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.43 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied error messages. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
