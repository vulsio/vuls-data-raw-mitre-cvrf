	"notes": {
		"description": "lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.0 is vulnerable to unauthorized evaluation creation due to missing server-side checks for user account status during evaluation creation. While the web UI restricts evaluation creation to paid accounts, the server-side API endpoint '/v1/evaluations' does not verify if the user has a paid account, allowing users with free or self-hosted accounts to create unlimited evaluations without upgrading their account. This vulnerability is due to the lack of account status validation in the evaluation creation process.",
