		"description": "An Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows a network-based, unauthenticated attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). If an attacker sends high rate of specific ICMP traffic to a device with VXLAN configured, this causes a deadlock of the PFE and results in the device becoming unresponsive. A manual restart will be required to recover the device. This issue only affects EX4100, EX4400, EX4600, QFX5000 Series devices. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS * 21.4R3 versions earlier than 21.4R3-S4; * 22.1R3 versions earlier than 22.1R3-S3; * 22.2R2 versions earlier than 22.2R3-S1; * 22.3 versions earlier than 22.3R2-S2, 22.3R3; * 22.4 versions earlier than 22.4R2; * 23.1 versions earlier than 23.1R2.",
