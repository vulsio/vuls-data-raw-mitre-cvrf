		"description": "A Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series allows an adjacent, unauthenticated attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). If an MX Series device receives PTP packets on an MPC3E that doesn't support PTP this causes a memory leak which will result in unpredictable behavior and ultimately in an MPC crash and restart. To monitor for this issue, please use the following FPC vty level commands: show heap shows an increase in \"LAN buffer\" utilization and show clksync ptp nbr-upd-info shows non-zero \"Pending PFEs\" counter. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series with MPC3E: * All versions earlier than 20.4R3-S3; * 21.1 versions earlier than 21.1R3-S4; * 21.2 versions earlier than 21.2R3; * 21.3 versions earlier than 21.3R2-S1, 21.3R3; * 21.4 versions earlier than 21.4R2; * 22.1 versions earlier than 22.1R2.",
