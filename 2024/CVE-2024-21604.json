			"type": "Description",
			"text": "An Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling vulnerability in the kernel of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). If a high rate of specific valid packets are processed by the routing engine (RE) this will lead to a loss of connectivity of the RE with other components of the chassis and thereby a complete and persistent system outage. Please note that a carefully designed lo0 firewall filter will block or limit these packets which should prevent this issue from occurring. The following log messages can be seen when this issue occurs: <host> kernel: nf_conntrack: nf_conntrack: table full, dropping packet This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved: * All versions earlier than 20.4R3-S7-EVO; * 21.2R1-EVO and later versions; * 21.4-EVO versions earlier than 21.4R3-S5-EVO; * 22.1-EVO versions earlier than 22.1R3-S2-EVO; * 22.2-EVO versions earlier than 22.2R3-EVO; * 22.3-EVO versions earlier than 22.3R2-EVO; * 22.4-EVO versions earlier than 22.4R2-EVO."
