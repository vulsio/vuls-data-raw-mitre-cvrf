		"description": "A Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in Routing Protocol Daemon (RPD) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause an rpd crash, leading to Denial of Service (DoS). On all Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved platforms, when traffic engineering is enabled for OSPF or ISIS, and a link flaps, a patroot memory leak is observed. This memory leak, over time, will lead to an rpd crash and restart. The memory usage can be monitored using the below command. user@host> show task memory detail | match patroot This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS * All versions earlier than 21.2R3-S3; * 21.3 versions earlier than 21.3R3-S5; * 21.4 versions earlier than 21.4R3-S3; * 22.1 versions earlier than 22.1R3; * 22.2 versions earlier than 22.2R3.
