			"text": "DataHub is an open-source metadata platform. In affected versions a low privileged user could remove a user, edit group members, or edit another user's profile information. The default privileges gave too many broad permissions to low privileged users. These have been constrained in PR #9067 to prevent abuse. This issue can result in privilege escalation for lower privileged users up to admin privileges, potentially, if a group with admin privileges exists. May not impact instances that have modified default privileges. This issue has been addressed in datahub version 0.12.1. Users are advised to upgrade."
