		"description": "An issue was discovered in Mbed TLS 2.x before 2.28.7 and 3.x before 3.5.2. There was a timing side channel in RSA private operations. This side channel could be sufficient for a local attacker to recover the plaintext. It requires the attacker to send a large number of messages for decryption, as described in \"Everlasting ROBOT: the Marvin Attack\" by Hubert Kario.",
