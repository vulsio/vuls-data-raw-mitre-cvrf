	"notes": {
		"description": "ThinkSystem SR670V2 servers manufactured from approximately June 2021 to July 2023 were left in Manufacturing Mode which could allow an attacker with privileged logical access to the host or physical access to server internals to modify or disable Intel Boot Guard firmware integrity, SPS security, and other SPS configuration setting. The serverâ€™s NIST SP 800-193-compliant Platform Firmware Resiliency (PFR) security subsystem significantly mitigates this issue.",
