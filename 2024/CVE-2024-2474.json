			"type": "Description",
			"text": "The Standout Color Boxes and Buttons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'color-button' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 0.7.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page."
