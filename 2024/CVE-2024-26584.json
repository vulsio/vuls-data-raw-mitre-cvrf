		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net: tls: handle backlogging of crypto requests Since we're setting the CRYPTO_TFM_REQ_MAY_BACKLOG flag on our requests to the crypto API, crypto_aead_{encrypt,decrypt} can return -EBUSY instead of -EINPROGRESS in valid situations. For example, when the cryptd queue for AESNI is full (easy to trigger with an artificially low cryptd.cryptd_max_cpu_qlen), requests will be enqueued to the backlog but still processed. In that case, the async callback will also be called twice: first with err == -EINPROGRESS, which it seems we can just ignore, then with err == 0. Compared to Sabrina's original patch this version uses the new tls_*crypt_async_wait() helpers and converts the EBUSY to EINPROGRESS to avoid having to modify all the error handling paths. The handling is identical.",
