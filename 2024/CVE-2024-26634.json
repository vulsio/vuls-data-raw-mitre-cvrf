		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net: fix removing a namespace with conflicting altnames Mark reports a BUG() when a net namespace is removed. kernel BUG at net/core/dev.c:11520! Physical interfaces moved outside of init_net get \"refunded\" to init_net when that namespace disappears. The main interface name may get overwritten in the process if it would have conflicted. We need to also discard all conflicting altnames. Recent fixes addressed ensuring that altnames get moved with the main interface, which surfaced this problem.",
