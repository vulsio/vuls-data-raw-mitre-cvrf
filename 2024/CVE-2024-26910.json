		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: netfilter: ipset: fix performance regression in swap operation The patch \"netfilter: ipset: fix race condition between swap/destroy and kernel side add/del/test\", commit 28628fa9 fixes a race condition. But the synchronize_rcu() added to the swap function unnecessarily slows it down: it can safely be moved to destroy and use call_rcu() instead. Eric Dumazet pointed out that simply calling the destroy functions as rcu callback does not work: sets with timeout use garbage collectors which need cancelling at destroy which can wait. Therefore the destroy functions are split into two: cancelling garbage collectors safely at executing the command received by netlink and moving the remaining part only into the rcu callback.",
