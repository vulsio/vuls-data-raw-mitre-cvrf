		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: drm/nouveau: fix several DMA buffer leaks Nouveau manages GSP-RM DMA buffers with nvkm_gsp_mem objects. Several of these buffers are never dealloced. Some of them can be deallocated right after GSP-RM is initialized, but the rest need to stay until the driver unloads. Also futher bullet-proof these objects by poisoning the buffer and clearing the nvkm_gsp_mem object when it is deallocated. Poisoning the buffer should trigger an error (or crash) from GSP-RM if it tries to access the buffer after we've deallocated it, because we were wrong about when it is safe to deallocate. Finally, change the mem->size field to a size_t because that's the same type that dma_alloc_coherent expects.",
