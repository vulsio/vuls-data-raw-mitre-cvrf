			"type": "Description",
			"text": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: s390/cio: fix race condition during online processing A race condition exists in ccw_device_set_online() that can cause the online process to fail, leaving the affected device in an inconsistent state. As a result, subsequent attempts to set that device online fail with return code ENODEV. The problem occurs when a path verification request arrives after a wait for final device state completed, but before the result state is evaluated. Fix this by ensuring that the CCW-device lock is held between determining final state and checking result state. Note that since: commit 2297791c92d0 (\"s390/cio: dont unregister subchannel from child-drivers\") path verification requests are much more likely to occur during boot, resulting in an increased chance of this race condition occurring."
