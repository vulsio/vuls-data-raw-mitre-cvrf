		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: drm/amd/display: fix NULL checks for adev->dm.dc in amdgpu_dm_fini() Since 'adev->dm.dc' in amdgpu_dm_fini() might turn out to be NULL before the call to dc_enable_dmub_notifications(), check beforehand to ensure there will not be a possible NULL-ptr-deref there. Also, since commit 1e88eb1b2c25 (\"drm/amd/display: Drop CONFIG_DRM_AMD_DC_HDCP\") there are two separate checks for NULL in 'adev->dm.dc' before dc_deinit_callbacks() and dc_dmub_srv_destroy(). Clean up by combining them all under one 'if'. Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with static analysis tool SVACE.",
