		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: tmpfs: fix race on handling dquot rbtree A syzkaller reproducer found a race while attempting to remove dquot information from the rb tree. Fetching the rb_tree root node must also be protected by the dqopt->dqio_sem, otherwise, giving the right timing, shmem_release_dquot() will trigger a warning because it couldn't find a node in the tree, when the real reason was the root node changing before the search starts: Thread 1 Thread 2 - shmem_release_dquot() - shmem_{acquire,release}_dquot() - fetch ROOT - Fetch ROOT - acquire dqio_sem - wait dqio_sem - do something, triger a tree rebalance - release dqio_sem - acquire dqio_sem - start searching for the node, but from the wrong location, missing the node, and triggering a warning.",
