This issue affects Apache Wicket: from 9.1.0 through 9.16.0, and the milestone releases for the 10.0 series. Apache Wicket 8.x does not support CSRF protection via the fetch metadata headers and as such is not affected. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 9.17.0 or 10.0.0, which fixes the issue."
