			"type": "Description",
			"text": "JWCrypto implements JWK, JWS, and JWE specifications using python-cryptography. Prior to version 1.5.6, an attacker can cause a denial of service attack by passing in a malicious JWE Token with a high compression ratio. When the server processes this token, it will consume a lot of memory and processing time. Version 1.5.6 fixes this vulnerability by limiting the maximum token length."
