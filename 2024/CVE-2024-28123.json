			"type": "Description",
			"text": "Wasmi is an efficient and lightweight WebAssembly interpreter with a focus on constrained and embedded systems. In the WASMI Interpreter, an Out-of-bounds Buffer Write will arise if the host calls or resumes a Wasm function with more parameters than the default limit (128), as it will surpass the stack value. This doesnâ€™t affect calls from Wasm to Wasm, only from host to Wasm. This vulnerability was patched in version 0.31.1."
