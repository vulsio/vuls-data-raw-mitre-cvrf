		"description": "Owncast is an open source, self-hosted, decentralized, single user live video streaming and chat server. In versions 0.1.2 and prior, a lenient CORS policy allows attackers to make a cross origin request, reading privileged information. This can be used to leak the admin password. Commit 9215d9ba0f29d62201d3feea9e77dcd274581624 fixes this issue.",
