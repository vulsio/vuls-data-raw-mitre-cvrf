	"notes": {
		"description": "Serverpod is an app and web server, built for the Flutter and Dart ecosystem. This bug bypassed the validation of TSL certificates on all none web HTTP clients in the `serverpod_client` package. Making them susceptible to a man in the middle attack against encrypted traffic between the client device and the server. An attacker would need to be able to intercept the traffic and highjack the connection to the server for this vulnerability to be used. Upgrading to version `1.2.6` resolves this issue.",
