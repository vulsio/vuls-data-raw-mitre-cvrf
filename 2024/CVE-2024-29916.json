			"type": "Description",
			"text": "The dormakaba Saflok system before the November 2023 software update allows an attacker to unlock arbitrary doors at a property via forged keycards, if the attacker has obtained one active or expired keycard for the specific property, aka the \"Unsaflok\" issue. This occurs, in part, because the key derivation function relies only on a UID. This affects, for example, Saflok MT, and the Confidant, Quantum, RT, and Saffire series."
