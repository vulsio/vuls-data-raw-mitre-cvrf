	"notes": {
		"description": "The Essential Addons for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 5.9.13 via deserialization of untrusted input from the 'error_resetpassword' attribute of the \"Login | Register Form\" widget (disabled by default). This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.",
