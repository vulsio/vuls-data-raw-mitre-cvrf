		"description": "** DISPUTED ** A shell injection vulnerability was discovered in ROS (Robot Operating System) Kinetic Kame in ROS_VERSION 1 and ROS_ PYTHON_VERSION 3, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code, escalate privileges, and obtain sensitive information due to the way ROS handles shell command execution in components like command interpreters or interfaces that process external inputs. NOTE: this is disputed by multiple third parties who believe there was not reasonable evidence to determine the existence of a vulnerability.",
