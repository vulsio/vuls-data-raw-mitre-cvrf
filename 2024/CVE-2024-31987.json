			"text": "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Starting in version 6.4-milestone-1 and prior to versions 4.10.19, 15.5.4, and 15.10-rc-1, any user who can edit any page like their profile can create a custom skin with a template override that is executed with programming right, thus allowing remote code execution. This has been patched in XWiki 14.10.19, 15.5.4 and 15.10RC1. No known workarounds are available except for upgrading."
