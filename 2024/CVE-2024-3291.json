		"description": "When installing Nessus Agent to a directory outside of the default location on a Windows host, Nessus Agent versions prior to 10.6.4 did not enforce secure permissions for sub-directories. This could allow for local privilege escalation if users had not secured the directories in the non-default installation location.",
