		"description": "The Colibri Page Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via image alt data parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.262 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
