			"text": "Totolink AC1200 Wireless Dual Band Gigabit Router A3002RU_V3 Firmware V3.0.0-B20230809.1615 is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow. The \"boa\" program allows attackers to modify the value of the \"vwlan_idx\" field via \"formMultiAP\". This can lead to a stack overflow through the \"formWlEncrypt\" CGI function by constructing malicious HTTP requests and passing a WLAN SSID value exceeding the expected length, potentially resulting in command execution or denial of service attacks."
