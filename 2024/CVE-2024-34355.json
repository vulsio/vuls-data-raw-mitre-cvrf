		"description": "TYPO3 is an enterprise content management system. Starting in version 13.0.0 and prior to version 13.1.1, the history backend module is vulnerable to HTML injection. Although Content-Security-Policy headers effectively prevent JavaScript execution, adversaries can still inject malicious HTML markup. Exploiting this vulnerability requires a valid backend user account. TYPO3 version 13.1.1 fixes the problem described.",
