		"description": "A vulnerability was discovered in the Alta Recovery Vault feature of Veritas NetBackup before 10.4 and NetBackup Appliance before 5.4. By design, only the cloud administrator should be able to disable the retention lock of Governance mode images. This vulnerability allowed a NetBackup administrator to modify the expiration of backups under Governance mode (which could cause premature deletion).",
