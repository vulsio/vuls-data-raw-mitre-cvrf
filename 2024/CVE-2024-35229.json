			"text": "ZKsync Era is a layer 2 rollup that uses zero-knowledge proofs to scale Ethereum. Prior to version 1.3.10, there is a very specific pattern `f(a(),b()); check_if_a_executed_last()` in Yul that exposes a bug in evaluation order of Yul function arguments. This vulnerability has been fixed in version 1.3.10. As a workaround, update and redeploy affected contracts."
