		"description": "** DISPUTED ** libyaml 0.2.5 is vulnerable to a heap-based Buffer Overflow in yaml_document_add_sequence in api.c. NOTE: the supplier disputes this because the finding represents a user error. The problem is that the application, which was making use of the libyaml library, omitted the required calls to the yaml_document_initialize and yaml_document_delete functions.",
