	"notes": {
		"description": "The WordPress Backup & Migration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the wp_mgdp_populate_popup function in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.8. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber access or above, to invoke this function and access log files maintained by the plugin. Additionally, the file name is user-provided and not properly sanitized, which allows attackers to read arbitrary log files on the file system.",
