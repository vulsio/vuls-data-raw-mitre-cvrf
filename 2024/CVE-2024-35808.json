		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: md/dm-raid: don't call md_reap_sync_thread() directly Currently md_reap_sync_thread() is called from raid_message() directly without holding 'reconfig_mutex', this is definitely unsafe because md_reap_sync_thread() can change many fields that is protected by 'reconfig_mutex'. However, hold 'reconfig_mutex' here is still problematic because this will cause deadlock, for example, commit 130443d60b1b (\"md: refactor idle/frozen_sync_thread() to fix deadlock\"). Fix this problem by using stop_sync_thread() to unregister sync_thread, like md/raid did.",
