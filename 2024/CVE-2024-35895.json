		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: bpf, sockmap: Prevent lock inversion deadlock in map delete elem syzkaller started using corpuses where a BPF tracing program deletes elements from a sockmap/sockhash map. Because BPF tracing programs can be invoked from any interrupt context, locks taken during a map_delete_elem operation must be hardirq-safe. Otherwise a deadlock due to lock inversion is possible, as reported by lockdep: CPU0 CPU1 ---- ---- lock(&htab->buckets[i].lock); local_irq_disable(); lock(&host->lock); lock(&htab->buckets[i].lock); <Interrupt> lock(&host->lock); Locks in sockmap are hardirq-unsafe by design. We expects elements to be deleted from sockmap/sockhash only in task (normal) context with interrupts enabled, or in softirq context. Detect when map_delete_elem operation is invoked from a context which is _not_ hardirq-unsafe, that is interrupts are disabled, and bail out with an error. Note that map updates are not affected by this issue. BPF verifier does not allow updating sockmap/sockhash from a BPF tracing program today.",
