		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: bnxt_en: Fix possible memory leak in bnxt_rdma_aux_device_init() If ulp = kzalloc() fails, the allocated edev will leak because it is not properly assigned and the cleanup path will not be able to free it. Fix it by assigning it properly immediately after allocation.",
