			"type": "Description",
			"text": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: tpm_tis_spi: Account for SPI header when allocating TPM SPI xfer buffer The TPM SPI transfer mechanism uses MAX_SPI_FRAMESIZE for computing the maximum transfer length and the size of the transfer buffer. As such, it does not account for the 4 bytes of header that prepends the SPI data frame. This can result in out-of-bounds accesses and was confirmed with KASAN. Introduce SPI_HDRSIZE to account for the header and use to allocate the transfer buffer."
