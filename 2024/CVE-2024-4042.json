			"type": "Description",
			"text": "The Post Grid, Form Maker, Popup Maker, WooCommerce Blocks, Post Blocks, Post Carousel â€“ Combo Blocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'class' attribute of the menu-wrap-item block in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.80 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page."
