		"description": "The LayerSlider plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's ls_search_form shortcode in version 7.11.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
