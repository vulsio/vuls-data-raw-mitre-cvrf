		"description": "The Rank Math SEO with AI Best SEO Tools plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘id’ parameter in versions up to, and including, 1.0.218 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
