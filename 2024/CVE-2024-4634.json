		"description": "The Elementor Header & Footer Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘hfe_svg_mime_types’ function in versions up to, and including, 1.6.28 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
