		"description": "The Menu Icons by ThemeIsle plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘add_mime_type’ function in versions up to, and including, 0.13.13 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
