			"type": "Description",
			"text": "Hardcoded credentials vulnerability in Trellix ePolicy Orchestrator (ePO) on Premise prior to 5.10 Service Pack 1 Update 2 allows an attacker with admin privileges on the ePO server to read the contents of the orion.keystore file, allowing them to access the ePO database encryption key. This was possible through using a hard coded password for the keystore. Access Control restrictions on the file mean this would not be exploitable unless the user is the system admin for the server that ePO is running on."
