	"notes": {
		"description": "The Bricks Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.8 via the postId parameter due to missing validation on a user controlled key. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to modify posts and pages created by other users including admins. As a requirement for this, an admin would have to enable access to the editor specifically for such a user or enable it for all users with a certain user account type.",
