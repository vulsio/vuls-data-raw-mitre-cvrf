		"description": "The User Registration â€“ Custom Registration Form, Login Form, and User Profile WordPress Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'import_form_action' function in versions up to, and including, 3.2.0.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level permissions and above, to import a registration form with a default user role of administrator. If an administrator approves or publishes a post or page with the shortcode to the imported form, any user can register as an administrator.",
