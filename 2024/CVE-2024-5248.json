			"type": "Description",
			"text": "In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.5, an improper access control vulnerability exists due to a missing permission check in the `GET /v1/users/me/org` endpoint. The platform's role definitions restrict the `Prompt Editor` role to prompt management and project viewing/listing capabilities, explicitly excluding access to user information. However, the endpoint fails to enforce this restriction, allowing users with the `Prompt Editor` role to access the full list of users in the organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access to sensitive user information, violating the intended access controls."
