			"text": "The Stratum – Elementor Widgets plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘label_years’ attribute within the Countdown widget in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page."
