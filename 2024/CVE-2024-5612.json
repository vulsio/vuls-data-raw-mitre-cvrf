		"description": "The Essential Addons for Elementor Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘eael_lightbox_open_btn_icon’ parameter within the Lightbox & Modal widget in all versions up to, and including, 5.8.15 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
