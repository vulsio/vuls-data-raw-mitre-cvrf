			"type": "Description",
			"text": "Deep Sea Electronics DSE855 Multipart Boundary Stack-Based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Deep Sea Electronics DSE855 devices. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the handling of multipart boundaries. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the device. Was ZDI-CAN-23170."
